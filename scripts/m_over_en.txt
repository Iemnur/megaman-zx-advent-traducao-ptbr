When Buckfire jumps up high,
go for his weak spot, his
mane! But be careful. The
closer you get, the harder
it is to dodge his Burning
Arrow. When Buckfire lands,
fight him from as far away
as you can!
<*********************>


To avoid Rospark's attacks
you'll need to try to stay
behind him as much as
possible. Use the walls to
Dash Jump over him. Stay
down low and his Giga Laser
won't be able to touch you!
<*********************>


Jump over the Ice Needles
just enough so that you land
in the space between them
and Chronoforce himself.
Memorize the angle and
timing of the Ice Carnival,
so you can dodge them
without getting flustered.
<*********************>


Dealing with either of
Queenbee's auxiliary
weapons container attacks
can be a prickly
proposition! But, since
they are fire attacks, you
can counter them with an
electric attack! 
<*********************>


Vulturon's flight pattern
makes it dangerous to stand
in the center of the room!
When the speaker appears,
try not to stand in front of
it. If the soundwaves hit
you, you'll be stunned
temporarily!
<*********************>


To keep up with Argoyle and
Ugoyle's combinations,
A-Trance into someone that
can move with lightning
speed. For their tandem Rock
Bomb attacks, you're safe as
long as you are above or
below Ugoyle!
<*********************>


Hedgeshock's Rolling Dash
will probably miss you, if
you stand on the scaffolding
at the top left or right of
the screen. Come down and
attack her from behind, then
get back up on the
scaffolding.
<*********************>


When Bifrost has his mouth
open, your attacks will be
deflected. Try not to get
too close. When his mouth
closes, that's your chance
to hit him with charged fire
attack and inflict maximum
damage!
<*********************>


Aeolus is good at saber
attacks while jumping and
dashing, so keep your
distance! Avoid his attacks
by dashing under him when
he's airborne, and jumping
over him while he's on the
ground.
<*********************>


Fire attacks are effective
against the ice Mega Man,
Thetis! Firm footing is
scarce in this stage, but
with Chronoforce, who's
perfectly at home in the
water, it doesn't have to be
a losing battle!
<*********************>


Atlas roams the boss area
attacking with her Knuckle
Buster from all different
angles. Look for an opening
when she's firing rounds
continuously in succession,
and then strike!
<*********************>


Wait for Siarnaq to reappear
after he does his Shadow
Dash, and then counter
attack. Just remember to
"stick and move".
<*********************>


Get hit with the Model ZX
Triple attack, and you'll be
in critical condition!
Whatever you do, don't get
pulled in to close-quarters
combat! When Model ZX is on
a wall, that's the time to
attack!
<*********************>


The only way to damage Dogu
the Giant is to aim for the
eyes. Jump up on Dogu's
hands when they come down,
and when you're at Dogu's
eye level, let your Buster
rip!
<*********************>


The only way to damage Dogu
the Giant is to aim for the
eyes. Jump on Dogu's hands
when they come down, then
jump to blast Dogu in the
eyes!
<*********************>


Both Prometheus and Pandora
can switch their elemental
attack types! When Pandora
is using her staff, and when
Prometheus is in the middle,
on the ground are your best
chances to due the most
damage!
<*********************>


It's useless to attack any
of the 3 dragon heads. Focus
your attack on the cockpit
hatch in the torso. That's
where Albert is.
<*********************>


Temporarily paralyze
Albert's defenses by
damaging the Bits that
surround him. Then try to
shoot him down. The real
battle begins on the ground!
You'll need to use
everything in your arsenal!
