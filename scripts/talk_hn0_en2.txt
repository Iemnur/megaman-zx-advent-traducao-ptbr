<p 02><a 43><n 2B>
Say... Are you the
Hunter everybody's been
talking about?
<--------------------->

Oh, I apologize. It was
rude of me to not
introduce myself first.
<--------------------->

My name is Carley!
I'm a reporter.
<--------------------->

I specialize in
reporting about
Hunters.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 43><n 2B>
There was a time when I
was gung-ho about
<--------------------->

treasure hunting and
all that too.
<--------------------->

But now I'm convinced
that there's no better
treasure
<--------------------->

than information.
<--------------------->

I wonder if you'd let
me do a scoop on you...
<*********************>

<p 02><a 43><n 2B>
I was doing some
digging on these
<--------------------->

Reploids called
Pseudoroids.
<--------------------->

Turns out they
can actually repair
themselves.
<--------------------->

That means that even if
you blast them,
<--------------------->

they can come back to
life. Scary...
<*********************>

<p 02><a 43><n 2B>
I still can't believe
that Albert, one of the
Sage Trinity,
<--------------------->

was the one who created
Model W.
<--------------------->

It's no wonder there
are all these Mavericks
lately.
<--------------------->

As a reporter, I have a
responsibility
<--------------------->

to find out and report
the facts.
<--------------------->

When I consider the
power of my influence,
<--------------------->

it's hard to make a
decision.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 43><n 2B>
But when you become a
Hunter who's confident,
<--------------------->

danger seems to take a
back seat.
<--------------------->

I'm sure you've heard
this before.
<--------------------->

Hunters hunt
Pseudoroids to test
their skills.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 43><n 2B>
Is that a wish card
you're holding?
<--------------------->

I'd really like to
become a globe hopping
reporter
<--------------------->

who reports the facts
to people everywhere.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 43><n 2B>
Telling people about
your dreams is kind of
embarrassing, isn't it?
<--------------------->

My face is probably
bright red right now.
<--------------------->

Yeah, like this apple.
Here, I'll give it to
you!
<*********************>

<p 02><a 44><n 35>
My! Fancy meeting
someone else here. My
name is Peter!

I may not look it, but
I'm a Hunter.
<--------------------->

The others call me the
Chemical Hunter.
<--------------------->

You see, I do
scientific research
<--------------------->

that goes to benefit
the Hunter's
livelihood.
<--------------------->

But even though I'm a
Hunter in title,
<--------------------->

I leave the rigorous
physical part to the
others.
<--------------------->

Thank you so much for
your help.

Mnh? Who are you? Can't
you see I'm eating.
<--------------------->

Would you mind not
talking to me right
now?
<--------------------->

Eh? My name? ...It's
Owl. What about it?
<*********************>

<p 02><a 45><n 3A>
*munch munch munch*

Mmm, now that's

I tell ya, all I need
in this world is food!

Did you bring me
dessert or something?

I could just keep

My name is James.
<--------------------->

I'm a recycling Hunter.
I make my living
salvaging junk.

Well, looks like you've
finally come 'round to
recycling.
<--------------------->

Ya know, there's some
folks who'll never
change...
<--------------------->

They jus' can't,
I guess.
<--------------------->

Just a little junk can
turn into a mountain in
no time...
<--------------------->

Like this one.
<--------------------->

It's one thing to wake
up and smell the coffee
late, and another thing
<--------------------->

to not wake up at all,
let alone smell the
coffee... Ya get me?
<--------------------->

These Mechaniloids
around here,
<--------------------->

they come from all the
junk that people throw
away.
<--------------------->

Do ya know what that
means? People,
<--------------------->

the ones who threw away
that junk have, by
their own hand,
<--------------------->

put themselves on the
path to destruction.

*gasp!* Aren't you da
Model A Chosen One?
<--------------------->

Oh, my bad. I
forgot to introduce
myself!
<--------------------->

They call me John!
<--------------------->

I never thought I'd
meet a Mega Man in a
podunk camp like dis.
<--------------------->

It must be my lucky
day.
<--------------------->

Well, I hadn't been too
lucky'till you showed
up...
<--------------------->

I'd just come in
this room, when the
door
<--------------------->

decided to stop
workin'. I've been
trapped in here since.
<--------------------->

I don't know what
woulda happened if you
didn't come along.

People's always sayin'
I don't look like no
Hunter,
<--------------------->

but I can get busy wit
da best of 'em!
<--------------------->

Yo, check it! I found
this lost
<--------------------->

technology out in the
ruins!
<--------------------->

It's called an Absorber
or somethin'. It's like
some kinda chip.
<--------------------->

Go ahead and equip it.
It's still usable.
<--------------------->

I hate to part wit it,
ya know whadahmsayin'.
<--------------------->

But, for you, I'll make
a deal!
<--------------------->

Hol' on, hol' on, let
me see...
<--------------------->

It cost me 35 EC to
get to da Scrapyard...
<--------------------->

Lunch cost about 26
EC... 18 EC for
shipping...
<--------------------->

Then 21 EC to have it
fixed... All together,
dat's like 100 EC...
<--------------------->

I'm tryin' to get
100 EC for it,
<--------------------->

but I'll let
you have it for 99 EC!
<--------------------->

<p 02><e 01><a 47><n 3E>
So, how 'bout it?
  Yes
  No
<*********************>

<p 02><a 47><n 3E>
I knew you'd like dat
deal! Thanks, Playa!
<*********************>

<p 02><s 01><a 47><n 3E>
What? Ya jus gonna do
me like dat, huh!?
<--------------------->

Well, jus let me know
if you change your
mind.
<*********************>


You're gonna hafta
listen to pitch all
over again.
<--------------------->

But hey, that's jus
the way I hustle.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 47><n 3E>
I ain't got nutin' to
sell right now!
<--------------------->

I don't take returns,
so if it don't work, I
can't help ya!
<*********************>

<p 02><a 47><n 3E>
Are you jivin' me, man?
You ain't got enough
E-Crystals!
<*********************>

<p 02><a 48><n 36>
OK, I'll explain it
once again. That device
is called a Warp Point.
<--------------------->

You can use the
transerver back there
any time
<--------------------->

to go to wherever there
is a Warp Point.
<--------------------->

But it looks like that
one isn't working,
<--------------------->

because it's all out of
power.
<--------------------->

If you have enough
E-Crystals,
<--------------------->

you can press up on the
<dpad>Control Pad and start
it up.
<--------------------->

You can look at the map
to see which areas are
accessible.
<--------------------->

When you start up the
Warp Point, the area
will light up red.
<--------------------->

So, you should be able
to find it right away.
<--------------------->

I wonder if you were
able to understand my
explanation,
<--------------------->

since I'm still in
training.
<--------------------->

Also, in Beginner Mode,
all you have to do is
touch it
<--------------------->

and it will start up
automatically!
<--------------------->

If you don't understand
something, please ask
me again, OK?
<*********************>

<p 02><a 48><n 36>
You can only transport
to a Warp Point through
a transerver.
<--------------------->

Get on the transerver
and select "Transport".
<--------------------->

Either touch the area
you want to go to on
the map
<--------------------->

on the bottom screen or
use the <dpad>Control Pad
to move the cursor
<--------------------->

and highlight it!
<--------------------->

Accessible transport
destinations will be
flashing red,
<--------------------->

so they're easy to
spot!

<p 02><a 48><n 36>
Do you have your Warp
Points turned on?
<--------------------->

You may need to go back
to certain areas,
<--------------------->

so it's a good idea to
turn them on.
<--------------------->

Be sure to check your
map when new transport
destinations 
<--------------------->

are added to a
transerver. Because,
sometimes
<--------------------->

the cursor will show an
area you're seeing for
the first time!
<--------------------->

Keep a close eye out
for those!
<*********************>

<p 02><a 48><n 36>
You have a wish card
there. What's your
wish?
<--------------------->

My wish is for world
peace...
<--------------------->

Because it's hard to
look at wounded people
coming home everyday.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 48><n 36>
You get hurt in battle
too, don't you?
<--------------------->

I know there isn't much
I can do, but that's
my wish anyway.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 49><n 43>
My, my, what have we
here!?
<--------------------->

If it isn't the famous
Model A Chosen One.
<--------------------->

Oh, I almost forgot, my
name is Rudy.
<--------------------->

You'll have to pardon
my appearance.
<--------------------->

I can assure you that
my looks belie my true
self.
<--------------------->

Truth be told... And
this is strictly
between you and me,
<--------------------->

a simple transport
device has come into my
possession.
<--------------------->

Unfortunately, I cannot
sell it. However,
<--------------------->

I can let you use it on
an as-needed basis for
50 EC!
<--------------------->

The thing is, because
of the low power
output,
<--------------------->

you can only use it to
return to Hunter's
Camp.
<*********************>

<p 02><e 63><a 49><n 43>
Do you need to use it? 
  No
  Yes
<*********************>

<p 02><a 49><n 43>
OK, here you go!
3...2...1...0!
<*********************>

<p 02><a 49><n 43>
Oh well... If you ever
need to use it, just
let me know.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 49><n 43>
My, my, it looks like
you don't have enough
E-Crystals...
<*********************>

<p 02><a 49><n 43>
Well, well... Do you
want to use my
transport device?
<*********************>

<p 02><a 49><n 43>
Well, well... Do you
want to use my
transport device?

<p 02><a 49><n 43>

Brrrr! It's cold. I
should have dressed
warmer.

Er, are you a Hunter

Nice to meet you!

It's really cold here.
<--------------------->

This hood, I usually
just wear it because it
looks cute...
<--------------------->

But it's not much help
on days like this.
<--------------------->

It is good for
hearing far-away
sounds, though.

<p 02><a 4B><n 45>
Whoa... You don't see
many people around here
dressed like that.
<--------------------->

Are you supposed to be
a new comic superhero
or something?
<--------------------->

...
<--------------------->

I get it, you haven't
come up with a name for
yourself yet...
<--------------------->

That's cool.
<--------------------->

My name is Ray. I
collect old comic
books.
<--------------------->

It's one of my hobbies.
<--------------------->

That's why the other
Hunters call me the
Comic Hunter.
<--------------------->

But, I'm not really all
THAT. *blush*
<*********************>

<p 02><a 4B><n 45>
The other day, I went
to a shop that's on the
way to Legion and
<--------------------->

bought some comics,
but, their selection
was so small.
<--------------------->

I guess it can't be
helped, though,
<--------------------->

because it was such a
small shop.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 4B><n 45>
By the way, is the
train fixed yet?
<--------------------->

*sigh* I can't go back
and buy any more comics
<--------------------->

until that train starts
running again.
<--------------------->

It'd be nice if I could
use the transerver,
<--------------------->

but, whenever I get on
it, I get really
nauseous.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 4B><n 45>
People ask me why I buy
so many comics, but I
think just like you can
<--------------------->

hate things for no
reason, you can like
things for no reason.
<--------------------->

I like reading comic
books more than digital
comics.
<--------------------->

There's just something
warm about them.
<--------------------->

The others do make fun
of me for my "senseless
obsession" though.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 4B><n 45>
You know, recently,
I've been writing my
own comic book.
<--------------------->

It's a story about this
robot that fights with
a folding fan
<--------------------->

in each hand. I guess
there was a comic with
a very similar
<--------------------->

storyline... It's not
easy to come up with
something
<--------------------->

that's completely
original.
