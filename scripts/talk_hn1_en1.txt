<p 02><a 4C><n 31>
Hey, nice to meet you!
My name is Jarke!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 4C><n 31>
If you're going to
Legion,
<--------------------->

you should enter the
door on the right!
<*********************>

<p 02><a 4C><n 31>
You know, yesterday I
took the train to
Legion.
<--------------------->

The desolate landscape
outside of
<--------------------->

Hunter's Camp looks
pretty dreary. 
<--------------------->

It's a far cry from the
bustling cityscape of
Legion.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 4C><n 31>
Are you really the
Model A Chosen One?
<--------------------->

If so, you should be
able to kick your way
<--------------------->

up that wall on the
right!
<--------------------->

If you go up from here
a ways, you'll come to
a red door.
<--------------------->

There's a big tower
covered in vines
<--------------------->

and a road that leads
to the Ice Floes.
<--------------------->

And past that are the
Oil Fields,
<--------------------->

where a lot of Hunters
go and look for booty!
<*********************>

<p 02><a 4C><n 31>
There are many places
in this world
<--------------------->

that you can't get to
by walking or on a
train.
<--------------------->

But if the coordinates
to a place are logged
in,
<--------------------->

you can get to where
you want to go via a
transerver.
<--------------------->

Me, I prefer to keep my
feet on the ground
<--------------------->

and travel the
old-fashioned way.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 4C><n 31>
You might want to visit
places more than once;
<--------------------->

you might find
something new there.
<--------------------->

Especially you, since
you have that A-Trans
ability,
<--------------------->

you definitely should
visit a lot of places!
<*********************>

<p 02><a 4D><n 2C>
What do you want
with me!?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 4D><n 2C>
Alright, I'll go ahead
and introduce myself
then.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 4D><n 2C>
I'm Roy! I've been a
Hunter for 3 years and
2 months.
<--------------------->

My hobby is cooking!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 4D><n 2C>
It's been a while since
I got a mission request
from Legion,
<--------------------->

so I bide my time
cooking for the other
Hunters.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 4D><n 2C>
But, sorry I don't have
anything for you!
<*********************>

<p 02><a 4D><n 2C>
Lately, with Mavericks
popping up all over the
place,
<--------------------->

Legion has been paying
bigger bounties.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 4D><n 2C>
Thanks to Legion, we
Hunters can put food on
the table.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 4D><n 2C>
Sorry about before. I
was a little harsh.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 4D><n 2C>
I'm not really good at
controlling my
emotions.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 4D><n 2C>
Aah, I should've never
become a Hunter.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 4D><n 2C>
Always in constant
danger. There's not
much free time.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 4D><n 2C>
You'd hurry up and quit
if you knew what was
good for you!
<*********************>

<p 02><a 4D><n 2C>
There's been a lot of
commotion outside
lately.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 4D><n 2C>
And sometimes there're
strange sounds coming
from underground.
<--------------------->

Is there some digging
going on nearby?
<*********************>

<p 02><a 4D><n 2C>
Is that a wish card
you're holding?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 4D><n 2C>
If I could make a wish,
I'd want to be
<--------------------->

the best Hunter slash
cook in the world.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 4D><n 2C>
I just finished making
the world's most
delicious apple pie.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 4D><n 2C>
This apple was left
over. If you want it,
I'll give it you.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 4E><n 2D>
...
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 69><n 2E>
Hello!? Is this the
first time we've met?
<--------------------->

My name is Blossom! And
this is my daddy!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 4E><n 2D>
...
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 69><n 2E>
Oh, my daddy's name is
Warren!
<*********************>

<p 02><a 69><n 2E>
Everyone in Hunter's
Camp is searching
<--------------------->

for something called
Biometal. They say it's
very valuable.
<--------------------->

The mission request
came from Legion.
<--------------------->

Isn't that right,
Daddy?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 4E><n 2D>
...
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 69><n 2E>
Some of the Hunters
have given up already;
<--------------------->

now they're looking for
other treasure.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 69><n 2E>
When I grow up, I'm
going to be a great
<--------------------->

Hunter and look for
booty too!
<--------------------->

Daddy, isn't that
right?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 4E><n 2D>
...
<*********************>

<p 02><a 69><n 2E>
I think Daddy met Mommy
when they were both
hunting in the ruins...
<--------------------->

Right, Daddy?
<--------------------->

Did you propose to
Mommy, or did Mommy
propose to you?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 4E><n 2D>
...
<*********************>

<p 02><a 69><n 2E>
Daddy, what's Model W?
Is it bad?
<--------------------->

Is that why all the
Mavericks keep coming
out everywhere?
<--------------------->

What's going to happen
to all of us?
<--------------------->

What if the Mavericks
try to get Mommy?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 4E><n 2D>
...
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 69><n 2E>
Daddy?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 4E><n 2D>
Don<72>t worry, flower.
It's going to be OK.
<--------------------->

We have to believe in
this Hunter.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 69><n 2E>
Huh? A present for me?
Thank you!
<--------------------->

It's sooo cuuuuute!
Daddy, look what I got!
A present!
<*********************>

<p 02><a 69><n 2E>
You can have this!
<--------------------->

I made it using a
recipe my mommy showed
me! Try it!
<*********************>

<p 02><a 4F><n 2F>
What are you looking
at? Do I have something
on my face?
<--------------------->

You must be 12 going on
20 if you think you can
talk to me!
<--------------------->

Remember that for the
next time we meet!
<*********************>

<p 02><a 4F><n 2F>
Don't get so close to
me! You're crowding my
space!
<--------------------->

Did I not just warn you
about that kind of
thing!?
<--------------------->

I don't want you
breathing down my neck.
I'm an elite Hunter!
<*********************>

<p 02><a 4F><n 2F>
*hmph* So you're
really going to accept
<--------------------->

that mission request
from Legion?
<--------------------->

I got bored of it after
3 days. I don't envy
you. 
<--------------------->

The bounty is small,
the risk is great, and
for what?
<--------------------->

I just don't see any
value in it!
<*********************>

<p 02><a 4F><n 2F>
Eh? You met the Sage
Trinity?
<--------------------->

That's something even
my father would have
trouble doing.
<--------------------->

How could someone the
likes of you meet
them!? 
<--------------------->

But I could care less!
<*********************>

<p 02><a 4F><n 2F>
What is all of the
commotion about here in
Hunter's Camp?
<--------------------->

Is this Model W really
all that valuable?
<--------------------->

Could it be worth more
than the estate I used
to live in?
<*********************>

<p 02><a 50><n 39>
I'm Tina! I used to run
with a group of
bandits!
<--------------------->

Don't worry, that's all
in my past.
<--------------------->

Now I make an honest
living as a Hunter!
<*********************>

<p 02><a 50><n 39>
It's kinda rough being
here for so long...
<--------------------->

The days used to seem
so much shorter when I
was a bandit.
<--------------------->

Now it can get pretty
boring. I miss the
old days.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 50><n 39>
There's some kind of
makeshift barrier under
this ladder. 
<--------------------->

It's just sewage down
there. They put
boulder's down there
<--------------------->

to keep kids from
playing around there.
<--------------------->

Just as a precaution,
they made it so that
<--------------------->

you need a green
card key to get in.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 50><n 39>
I used to think that
there were some things
<--------------------->

you couldn't get unless
you were a bandit.
<--------------------->

Looking back on it now,
I think that was just
me trying to
<--------------------->

rationalize and make
excuses for what I was
doing.
<--------------------->

I'm sorry. You're too
young to understand
this kind of talk.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 50><n 39>
Looks like everybody's
making a big fuss over
this Model W thing.
<--------------------->

People are saying that
it's the reason for
all these Mavericks.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 51><n 41>
Hey, did you come here
looking for the booty
too?
<--------------------->

I'm Meg, the antique
Hunter!

<p 02><a 51><n 41>
I once had a professor
who always said "Know
the old, know the new."
<--------------------->

Our job is not just
chasing after the
past...
<--------------------->

Remember the past to
better understand the
present. If you forget
<--------------------->

this, you become
nothing more than a
collector.

<p 02><a 52><n 38>
I'm Nick... Who are
you?
<--------------------->

As you can see, I'm an
old-model Reploid!
<--------------------->

Just because I'm old
doesn't mean that my
<--------------------->

life cycle settings are
any longer.
<--------------------->

It just means that I'm
a previous generation
Reploid.

Hey, I didn't know kids
liked to drink coffee.
<--------------------->

I'm Jim, and this is my
café.
<--------------------->

I used to make my
living as a Hunter,
<--------------------->

but I wasn't very good
with directions, you
know.
<--------------------->

I realized that it just
wasn't for me and got
out.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 53><n 3F>
I started this place
hoping it'd be
<--------------------->

somewhere the Hunters
could relax and enjoy
themselves.
<--------------------->

I'm still learning the
ropes of this business.
<--------------------->

And, making a lot of
mistakes too.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 53><n 3F>
Even now, though, I
reminisce about the
days when I used to
<--------------------->

travel around the
world.
<--------------------->

If I can't be a Hunter,
I want to be somebody
who
<--------------------->

chases after romance,
you know, a love
Hunter...
<--------------------->

Nah, I was just
kidding. Pretend you
never heard that.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 53><n 3F>
Those days working as a
Hunter were brutal,
<--------------------->

every day getting all
busted up...
<--------------------->

I remember falling off
of a cliff while we
were trekking in the
<--------------------->

mountains. I slid down
a waterfall and got
washed out to sea.
<--------------------->

I was always in the
infirmary...
<--------------------->

to the point they
called me a "frequent
faller".
<*********************>

<p 02><a 53><n 3F>
Anna who works in the
infirmary... Now she's
my type.
<--------------------->

But let's just keep
that between me and
you.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 54><n 3D>
Who are you? They call
me Pierre.
<--------------------->

I dunno where you're
trying to get to,
<--------------------->

but there ain't nothing
thataway.
<--------------------->

If you're trying to get
to the station, it's in
the opposite direction.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 54><n 3D>
Are you a Hunter too?
<--------------------->

If you are, you've
probably heard about
me.
<--------------------->

What? You've haven't!?
If you're gonna call
yourself a Hunter,
<--------------------->

you at least need to
know some basic
information.
<--------------------->

I'd like to tell you
all about the great
things I've done,
<--------------------->

but that would be just
tooting my own horn, so
I won't.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 54><n 3D>
They say you're the
Chosen One for Model A,
huh?
<--------------------->

This world is just full
of ironies, ain't it?
<--------------------->

Seriously though, I'm
probably more suited to
being a Mega Man.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 54><n 3D>
So, you know that
manhole to the left,
and up a ways?
<--------------------->

Underneath that is the
Quarry. They say it's
dangerous,
<--------------------->

so it's been double and
triple locked to keep
people out.
<--------------------->

Now if it was me, I
could get through it
no problem,
<--------------------->

but a regular Hunter
probably couldn't get
through it.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 54><n 3D>
You know, you're
lucky...
<--------------------->

If I was a Mega Man,
you'd have to fight me.
<--------------------->

You understand what I
mean?
<--------------------->

That's right! You just
barely escaped with
your life!
