Hello! My name is
Sharon!
<--------------------->

Are you trying to get
to that room up ahead
too?
<--------------------->

It seems like that
green door
<--------------------->

has some kind of
security lock on it.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 55><n 3B>
I wasn't really
interested in being a
Hunter at first,
<--------------------->

but now I like it.
<--------------------->

It's kind of fun to
check out different
areas.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 55><n 3B>
I know that handling
mission requests is
very important and all,
<--------------------->

but sometimes we need
to take a break from it
all.
<--------------------->

If they work us TOO
hard, we'll lose our
Hunter's edge.
<--------------------->

When I'm tired, I'll
borrow some comics from
Ray
<--------------------->

to take my mind off
things.
<--------------------->

I think I'll save up my
E-Crystals to buy some
comics of my own.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 55><n 3B>
Um, have you ever been
in that room over there
to left of that ladder?
<--------------------->

There are some blocks
in the way of the items
in that room.
<--------------------->

They're made so that if
you bust the center
block,
<--------------------->

the ones next to it
will break too.
<--------------------->

But, maybe you knew
that already.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 55><n 3B>
If you go through that
green door on the right
<--------------------->

and keep going
straight, you'll come
to a huge room.
<--------------------->

Go to the right of that
room and there's a
transerver 
<--------------------->

that has only one
transport destination,
the Lab.
<--------------------->

Go to the left, and
you'll go to the
Waterfall Ruins.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 56><n 3C>
Hello... Nice to meet
you... I think? Have we
met before?
<--------------------->

Anyways, my name is
Amy! I'm new at this
camp.
<--------------------->

I don't quite remember
everyone's face yet.

<p 02><a 56><n 3C>
I'm just a Hunter in
training,
<--------------------->

so I don't get many
mission requests from
Legion.
<--------------------->

I want to hurry up and
make a contribution,
<--------------------->

like the other great
Hunters around here.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 56><n 3C>
Going after that
Model W, that's a
dangerous request.
<--------------------->

I don't think I'd be
able to do it.
<--------------------->

I admire you for even
accepting a difficult
request like that.

So you're a Hunter too,
huh...
<--------------------->

Boy, there's just no
shortage of new
recruits lately.
<--------------------->

The name's Ward...
Pleased to meet you!
<--------------------->

I put bounties out on
the Mechaniloids that
show up around here,
<--------------------->

and I make the payouts
to those Hunters who
have the right stuff.
<--------------------->

If you think you've got
the right stuff,
<--------------------->

you should take a crack
at it.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 59><n 46>
Recently there've been
some sightings
<--------------------->

of wild Mechaniloids
near Hunter's Camp.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 59><n 46>
I heard through the
grapevine that you took
out those Pseudoroids
<--------------------->

that attacked the
train.
<--------------------->

It helps to have a fine
Hunter like you in our
ranks.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 59><n 46>
It looks like a
resurgence of
Pseudoroids
<--------------------->

is beginning all over
the world.
<--------------------->

We should probably
gather some info
<--------------------->

from the Hunters on the
roof who are on look
out.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 59><n 46>
The Pseudoroid
resurgence continues,
it seems.
<--------------------->

It could be Model W
causing it...

I'm Gary, the Data Room
Administrator.
<--------------------->

If you get your hands
on something called a
Secret Disk,
<--------------------->

you should bring it
here for analysis.
<--------------------->

It contains information
about enemies, etc.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 5B><n 48>
Feel free to use that
computer over there.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 5B><n 48>
How's the Secret Disk
collecting coming
along?
<*********************>

<p 02><a 5B><n 48>
You can learn a lot
when you analyze a
Secret Disk.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 5B><n 48>
Have you found many
Secret Disks?

Well, are you feeling
any better?
<--------------------->

I'm Anna. I give
Hunters medical
attention
<--------------------->

in the infirmary.
<--------------------->

The transerver isn't in
here, it's in room 04.
<--------------------->

To enter the door in
the back room,
<--------------------->

stand in front of it
and push up on the
<dpad>Control Pad!
<--------------------->

You can also push up on
the <dpad>Control Pad
<--------------------->

to examine items or
talk to someone!
<*********************>

<p 02><a 5E><n 42>
By the way, have you
gotten a Hunter's
License issued yet?
<--------------------->

If you haven't, you
should go to the room
with the transerver.
<--------------------->

If you already have,
then you should look
around Hunter's Camp.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 5E><n 42>
I heard the news...
<--------------------->

You guys are repairing
the train that goes to
Legion?
<--------------------->

Wow... a personal
request from the Sage
Trinity.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 5E><n 42>
They say Mavericks are
popping up
everywhere...
<--------------------->

I hope all the Hunter's
out there make it back
safely.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 5E><n 42>
I know requests from
Legion are important
and all,
<--------------------->

but don't overdo it,
OK?
<--------------------->

I'm not just telling
you that because I'm a
nurse,
<--------------------->

I'm asking you as a
friend.
<*********************>

<p 03><a 5E><n 42>
