Yo! Are you a Hunter
too? My name is Kidd!
<--------------------->

We've been drilling
here, trying to find
<--------------------->

some lost technology or
something.
<--------------------->

It takes a heckuva
lotta energy just to
run the drill.
<--------------------->

It ain't worth it, in
my opinion!
<--------------------->

But we found this place
that looks like it was
used as a room,
<--------------------->

buried under the earth
and sand.
<--------------------->

We can't give up cause
there could be
something down there.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 5F><n 33>
Thanks to your help, I
was able to dig a hole
this big!
<--------------------->

Not too bad despite
being so little, huh?

<*********************>

<p 02><a 60><n 34>
My name is Lem! And I
suppose you're the
Model A Chosen One?
<--------------------->

When I heard that the
lost technology was
around here,
<--------------------->

I could hardly believe
my ears, so I came to
see for myself.
<--------------------->

I had no idea this huge
underground place was
even here.
<--------------------->

If we dig just a little
more, there should be a
door down here.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 60><n 34>
I've been down here so
long now that I don't
<--------------------->

even know what's going
on up top.
<*********************>

<*********************>

<p 02><a 60><n 34>
These passageways down
here snake all over the
place.
<--------------------->

I'm thinking about
digging a shortcut.
<--------------------->

But the drill I'm using
is running low on
energy.
<--------------------->

I'm just about out of
ideas...
<--------------------->

Could you help me out
with 200 EC so I can
get some energy?
<--------------------->

<p 02><e 01><a 60><n 34>
Give 200 E-Crystals?
  Yes
  No
<*********************>

<p 02><a 60><n 34>
Thanks! I owe you one!
<--------------------->

Well, I'll get to back
to digging. So, come
back again!
<*********************>

<p 02><s 01><a 60><n 34>
Aw man! Well, I guess I
got no choice but to
give up...
<*********************>

<p 02><a 60><n 34>
As you can see, I'm a
whizz with the drill.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 60><n 34>
Thanks for the
thought...
<--------------------->

But you don't have
enough E-Crystals.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 62><n 30>
Who are you?
<--------------------->

They call me Chris! I'm
a real Hunter, make no
mistake about it!
<--------------------->

But, what I really want
more than some lost
technology
<--------------------->

is some toys!
<*********************>

<*********************>

<p 02><a 62><n 30>
Why am I way up here,
you ask?
<--------------------->

Well you see, I climbed
up this wall, but I
can't get down!
<*********************>

<p 02><a 62><n 30>
My dad says that a
Hunter needs to be
tough. So, I tried to
<--------------------->

get to the top of the
ridge to test my
toughness.
<--------------------->

But, it was a lot
scarier than I thought.
<--------------------->

The view IS nice from
up here...
<--------------------->

I think I'll make this
my secret place.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 62><n 30>
My dad told me that if
I want to be an elite
Hunter,
<--------------------->

I have to be daring and
bold.
<--------------------->

I tried to open the
manhole cover at the
<--------------------->

far end of Hunter's
Camp.
<--------------------->

But, it wouldn't budge!
I wonder...
<--------------------->

If I tried to pry it
open with something,
would it open?
<*********************>

<p 02><a 62><n 30>
From up here, if you
look way over there,
<--------------------->

you can see the
Mavericks closing in.
<--------------------->

It's really scary, but
I don't freak out.
<--------------------->

Because I'm a Hunter!
<*********************>

<p 02><a 62><n 30>
A present for me? Why
all of a sudden?
<--------------------->

Wow, the mini airship
that I wanted!
<*********************>

<p 02><a 62><n 30>
Thank you! It's not
much, but please take
this!
<*********************>

I had no idea there was

here.

I hear it's getting
rough outside.
Is that true?

Here, we're probably
safe from Mavericks,

but it's hard to shake
this bad feeling.

Oh, Hey! My name is

<--------------------->

I'm glad I was able to
become a Hunter,
<--------------------->

but I never knew it was
such a hard job.
<--------------------->

Today's my day off, so
I've been playing video
games.
<--------------------->

I'll let you borrow one
if you want. It's fun
to face off one-on-one!
<*********************>

<p 02><a 67><n 5B>
I'm glad you liked that
game I lent you.

<p 02><a 67><n 5B>

Gem Buster with one
of your friends?

<p 02><a 67><n 5B>
They say I'm the
biggest video game fan
in Hunter's Camp.
<--------------------->

I really like to play
challenging games!
Don't you?
<*********************>

<p 02><a 67><n 5B>
Looks like Mavericks
are closing in on this
area.
<--------------------->

But if we Hunters all
work together,
<--------------------->

we should be able to
hold them off.

it's getting difficult

you is called Spike

What's my job? I stand
guard to make sure no
<--------------------->

Mechaniloids come
close.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 42><n 23>
Lately, there's been
the smell of
<--------------------->

Mechaniloids in the
air.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 42><n 23>
Maverick rampages are
happening all over.
<--------------------->

We've got to be
careful.

<p 02><a 42><n 24>

<*********************>

<p 02><a 42><n 24>
Me and my friends were

<*********************>

<p 02><a 42><n 24>
They say you're the
Mega Man Model A Chosen
One.
<--------------------->

That's cool! What do
you gotta do to be a
Chosen One?
<*********************>

<p 02><a 42><n 24>
They say you've been
kickin' Pseudoroid butt
left and right.
<--------------------->

But we can't let our
guard down,
<--------------------->

just in case those
suckers try and make a
comeback.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 42><n 24>
I wonder if we can
defend this place all
by ourselves.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 42><n 25>
My name is Roger.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 42><n 25>
I know I'm way up here,
but actually, I'm
acrophobic.
<--------------------->

That means that I'm
afraid of heights. If I
just look down,
<--------------------->

I get the shakes
something awful.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 42><n 25>
This job keeps me on my
feet all day. My feet
hurt something fierce.
<--------------------->

I wish somebody would
hurry up and relieve me
of my post.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 42><n 25>
If the Mavericks come,
<--------------------->

how am I supposed to
face 'em down with this
puny weapon?
<*********************>

<p 02><a 42><n 25>
Dang! As if me being
acrophobic wasn't
enough,
<--------------------->

now these Mavericks
show up... *sigh*

<p 02><a 42><n 26>
My name is Kirk. I'm a

<p 02><a 42><n 26>

sunup to sundown.

<p 02><a 42><n 26>
If I had a better
weapon,
<--------------------->

I could take out those
Pseudoroids easy!
<*********************>

<p 02><a 42><n 26>
It's pretty boring just
standing guard at
Hunter's Camp.
<--------------------->

I want to take on a big
mission request like
you.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 42><n 27>
I'm Kyrian. Nice to

<*********************>

<p 02><a 42><n 27>

<p 02><a 42><n 27>
Hey, are you a Hunter
too?
<*********************>

<p 02><a 42><n 27>
Uh? What are we doing
here in a place like
this?
<--------------------->

Hunters without mission
requests split up and
<--------------------->

spread out to defend
the camp!
<*********************>

<p 02><a 42><n 27>
It seems like there are
more and more of these
Mavericks every day.
<--------------------->

I'm worried that we
might not be able to
hold them all off.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 42><n 27>
Things are about to get
ugly around here.

but for me,
<--------------------->

there's nothing else
I'd rather do.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 42><n 28>
So, you're going to
meet the Sage Trinity?
That's impressive!
<*********************>

<p 02><a 42><n 28>
Word gets around about
everything you do!
<--------------------->

It shows that you're
the Model A Chosen One!
<*********************>

<p 02><a 42><n 28>
The Maverick activity
increased just as we
got here.
<--------------------->

Could it be because of
that Biometal Model W?
<*********************>

<p 02><a 42><n 29>
I'm Abe. Glad to meet
you!
<*********************>

<p 02><a 42><n 29>
You're a new face in

up with the others and
do your job. Good luck!

<p 02><a 42><n 29>
So, you're the Model A

talking about.
<--------------------->

I didn't know; I'm kind

the latest news.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 42><n 29>

after run-in with
Mavericks.
<--------------------->

There were some pretty

feelin'?
<*********************>

<p 02><a 42><n 2A>
Frankly, I'd rather be
out there stompin' on
some Mechaniloids
<--------------------->

than standin' around
waitin' for the enemy
to come to me.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 42><n 2A>
Seems like those

<--------------------->

more and more outta
hand,
<--------------------->

what in the world could
be causin' it!?
<*********************>

<p 02><a 42><n 2A>

If you continue to the
right of the station,
<--------------------->

you'll find an elevator
that goes down.
<--------------------->

Get on top of the
elevator,
<--------------------->

and press down on the
<dpad>Control Pad to go
down.
<--------------------->

But be careful of the
Mini Cannon sentries.

Hello! I'm Patrick.

When there's no
Hunter work for me to
do,
<--------------------->

I do odd jobs here at
the station.

If you continue to the
right of the station,
<--------------------->

you'll find an elevator

It's good the train's
running again.
<--------------------->

We can move small cargo
through the
transervers,
<--------------------->

but, we still need to
rely on the train to
move large cargo.
<--------------------->

I don't have words to
thank you!
<*********************>

<p 02><a 42><n 4D>
There's Mavericks
crawling all over the
place!
<--------------------->

It's not even safe to
go outside!
<*********************>

<p 02><a 40><n 57>
Thank you for before!
As you can see I'm
doing better.
<--------------------->

My name is Tom. I
know I'm the one that
owes you,
<--------------------->

but, the holes don't
dig themselves for
free, ya know.
<--------------------->

Could you help me out
with a donation?

Fill up your Sub Tank

<p 02><a 98><n 54>

<p 02><a 98><n 54>
OK. Please come again.

<p 02><a 98><n 54>
It seems you do not
have a Sub Tank.

<p 02><a 98><n 54>

I'm Nina. I work the
station information
desk.
<--------------------->

You can ask me anything
about the station and
the surrounding area.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 95><n 52>
To get to the train, go
out that door and go
right.

Because of the train
accident,
<--------------------->

passenger numbers have
been dropping.
<--------------------->

I have to work hard to
ensure
<--------------------->

that the Hunters can
ride the train safely.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 95><n 52>
Good day!
<--------------------->

I heard you're the one
who got the parts
<--------------------->

together to fix the
train.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 95><n 52>
Good day!
<--------------------->

No one wants to ride
the train
<--------------------->

because of the recent
Maverick sightings.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 95><n 52>
This hardly makes up
for you fixing the
train,
<--------------------->

but please take it.

The wrench you brought
me was the new wrench I
had just bought.
<--------------------->

As soon as I got it, I
went around and showed
it off to everyone.
<--------------------->

And then I lost it.
<--------------------->

I guess it serves me
right, but it's not
cool.
<--------------------->

You know where I'm
coming from, right?
<--------------------->

Anyway, thanks to you,
I got it back!
