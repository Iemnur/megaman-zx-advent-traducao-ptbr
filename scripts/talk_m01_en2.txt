That device is called a

<p 02><a 48><n 36>
You can use the
transerver back there
any time to go
<--------------------->

to wherever there is a
Warp Point.

But it looks like that
one isn't working,

<--------------------->

because it's all out of
power.

If you have enough
E-Crystals, you can
press up on the
<--------------------->

<dpad>Control Pad and start
it up.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 48><n 36>
Let's start this one up
just for now.

<p 02><a 48><n 36>
You can look at the map

<p 02><a 48><n 36>
When you start up the
Warp Point, the area
will light up red. 
<--------------------->

So, you should be able
to find it right away.

<p 02><a 48><n 36>
I wonder if you were 
able to understand my
explanation,
<--------------------->

since I'm still in
training.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 48><n 36>
Also, in Beginner Mode,
all you have to do is
touch it
<--------------------->

and it will start up
automatically!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 48><n 36>
If you don't understand
something, please ask
me again, OK?
