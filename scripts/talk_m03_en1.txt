<p 03><d A600><a 42><n 1F>
For this mission, we
have to take this
container
<--------------------->

<d A700>
to Legion
Headquarters.
<--------------------->

<p 02><d A800><a 08><n 01>
Legion...? I guess
I've got a lot to
learn.
<--------------------->

<p 03><d AA00><a 42><n 1F>
...Man, you must've
bumped your head pretty
hard... Let's roll out!
<*********************>

<p 02><d AC00><a 42><n 1F>
Legion is the
coalition government
created after the war
<--------------------->

<d AD00>
several centuries ago,
by representatives from
every nation.
<--------------------->

<p 02><d AE00><a 42><n 1F>
It makes laws that
govern the lives of
Humans and Reploids. 
<--------------------->

<d AF00>
Basically, it's the
most powerful
organization on Earth. 
<--------------------->

<p 02><d B000><a 42><n 1F>
I bet the Legion
database has info about
you too.
<--------------------->

<d B100>
That's why I invited
you to come along.
<--------------------->

<p 03><d B200><a 08><n 01>
Isn't using a train for
just one container
overdoing it a little?
<--------------------->

<p 02><d B300><a 42><n 1F>
The stuff in that
container is called
Biometal.
<--------------------->

<p 02><d B400><a 42><n 1F>
It's very rare and very
valuable. We recovered
it from some Raiders
<--------------------->

<p 02><d B500><a 42><n 1F>
who pillaged it from
ancient ruins. Legion
pays huge bounties
<--------------------->

<d B600>
for Biometal. So,
there's a reason we
overdo it.
<--------------------->

<p 03><d B700><a 08><n 01>
Hmm, Biometal... Why
does that sound
familiar?
<*********************>

<p 03><d B800><a 05><n 00>
Does he know about
me...?
<*********************>

<p 03><d B900><a 0F><n 01>
Who said that!?
<*********************>

<p 03><d BA00><a 05><n 00>
Hm? You can hear me?
<*********************>

<p 03><d BB00><a 08><n 01>
What? Who's there...?
<*********************>

<p 03><d BC00><a 42><n 1F>
Dang! Mavericks!
<*********************>

<p 02><d BD00><a 42><n 1F>
They're going for the
engine! You wait here!
<*********************>

<p 03><d BE00><a 0F><n 01>
You!
<--------------------->

<p 02><d BF00><a 28><n 04>
There you are...
Defective Mega Man...
<*********************>

<p 01><p 03><d C000><a 25><n 00>
Pandora, you couldn't
dispose of this one
measly imp?
<--------------------->

<p 01><p 02><d C100><a 28><n 04>
My apologies,
Prometheus.
<--------------------->

<p 01><p 03><d C200><a 25><n 03>
No matter. We'll finish
him off and take back
the Biometal.
<--------------------->

<p 01><p 03><d C400><a 0B><n 01>
I've had it! Do you
think I'm just going to
sit here
<--------------------->

<d C500>
and let you two kill
me when I don't even
know why!?
<*********************>

<p 02><d C600><a 25><n 03>
Just lay there and die
quietly, scum.
<--------------------->

<p 03><d C700><a 0E><n 01>
No way! I'm... I'm...
<*********************>

<p 03><d C800><a 05><n 00>
Hey! Grey! If you want
to live, do as I say.
Since you can hear me,
<--------------------->

<p 03><d C900><a 05><n 00>
we should be able to
Megamerge! I'll lend
you my strength!
<--------------------->

<p 03><d CA00><a 0F><n 01>
W-Who are you?
<--------------------->

<p 03><d CB00><a 05><n 15>
I'm Biometal Model A!
Now I want you to
focus.
<--------------------->

<p 03><d CC00><a 05><n 15>
OK, yell, "MEGAMERGE!"
as loud as you can!
<*********************>

<p 01><p 03><d CD00><a 08><n 01>
This power coursing
through me...
What is it?
<--------------------->

<p 01><p 03><d CE00><a 08><n 01>
I feel like I know 
this power... This
is Mega Man power!
<*********************>

<p 02><d CF00><a 28><n 04>
Mega Man... Model A!
<--------------------->

<p 02><d D000><a 26><n 03>
*guffaw* Well, isn't
this a surprise! Our
Defective just
<--------------------->

<p 02><d D100><a 25><n 03>
Megamerged! I've got to
hand it to you. It
looks like you've
<--------------------->

<d D200>
got what it takes to
participate in this
little game.
<--------------------->

<p 02><d D300><a 28><n 04>
Prometheus...
Isn't that kid...?
<--------------------->

<p 02><d D400><a 25><n 03>
Hmph, no matter! So,
Grey... You can keep
the Model A, for now.
<--------------------->

<p 02><d D500><a 25><n 03>
You've got a few more 
encounters with other
Mega Men ahead of you.
<--------------------->

<p 02><d D600><a 25><n 03>
You must defeat them in
battle! If you somehow
manage to survive
<--------------------->

<d D700>
until the end, then
you'll know who you
really are...
<--------------------->

<p 02><d D800><a 26><n 03>
And perhaps all there
is to know about the
world!
<--------------------->

<d D900>
So, let the game begin!
HIS Game of Destiny!
<*********************>

<p 03><d DA00><a 0A><n 01>
Game of Destiny? What's
up with them...?
<*********************>

<p 02><d DB00><a 0F><n 01>
Oh, shoot! I have to
help the others!
<--------------------->

<p 02><d DC00><a 6B><n 15>
Wait a minute!
Shouldn't we be getting
out of here!?
<--------------------->

<p 02><d DD00><a 0A><n 01>
If you don't want to
come, transform me back
to normal,
<--------------------->

<d DE00>
and I'll go by myself!
<--------------------->

<p 02><d DF00><a 6B><n 15>
OK, OK, I'll go!
<--------------------->

<p 02><d E000><a 6B><n 15>
Anything is better than
what those guys were
going to do to me!
<--------------------->

<p 02><d E100><a 6B><n 15>
I'll help you... if you
promise not to leave
me. Deal?
<--------------------->

<p 02><d E200><a 0B><n 01>
...OK! Let's go!
<*********************>

<p 03><d E300><a 36><n 00>
*snort* *wheeze*!!
<*********************>

<p 03><d E400><a 36><n 00>
Model A!
You broke rule!

<--------------------->

<d E500>
You make big mistake.
The one you choose, no
good!
<--------------------->

<p 03><d E600><a 36><n 00>
He Defective! You lend
him your power, no
good!
<--------------------->

<p 02><d E700><a 6B><n 15>
Mistake? What're you
yapping about? You
don't know me!
<--------------------->

<p 02><d E800><a 08><n 01>
Who's this!? He's
different from the
other Mavericks...
<--------------------->

<p 03><d E900><a 36><n 08>
Me not Maverick! Me
Pseudoroid. Me
Buckfire!
<--------------------->

<p 03><d EA00><a 36><n 08>
You get away from
Prometheus and Pandora,
but not from I!
<--------------------->

<p 03><d EB00><a 36><n 08>
Buckfire obey rule!
Buckfire will pummel
you into ground!
<*********************>

<p 03><d EC00><a 36><n 08>
*snort* *wheeze*!! No
mercy for traitors!
That is rule!
<*********************>

<p 03><d ED00><a 36><n 08>
You!... traitor...
Our future... 
Our world...!
<--------------------->

<p 03><d EE00><a 36><n 08>
Yeeeoooow!
<*********************>

<p 02><d EF00><a 0F><n 01>
W-What just happened?
<--------------------->

<p 02><d F000><a 6B><n 15>
*chuckle* Do you want
to see something cool?
<--------------------->

<p 02><d F100><a 6B><n 15>
Touch the icon on the
bottom screen!
<*********************>

<p 02><d F200><a 6B><n 15>
This is my power,
A-Trans!
<--------------------->

<d F300>
I can morph into
anyone whose DNA I
copy!
<*********************>

<p 02><d F400><a 6B><n 15>
Touch the icon on the
bottom screen again,
and I can change back!
<*********************>

<p 02><d F500><a 0F><n 01>
Is that power why
everyone wants
Biometal so bad?
<--------------------->

<p 02><d F700><a 6B><n 15>
Beats me. I'm not even
sure why I was created.
<--------------------->

<p 02><d F800><a 6B><n 15>
This train is all out
of chug. So, let's head
back to the camp
<--------------------->

<p 02><d F900><a 6B><n 15>
and figure out another
way to get to Legion
Headquarters.
<--------------------->

<p 02><d FA00><a 08><n 01>
Are you going to help
me!?
<--------------------->

<p 02><d FB00><a 6B><n 15>
Well, it's that or
you'll leave me here,
right?
<--------------------->

<p 02><d FC00><a 6B><n 15>
Besides, we've got
goons after us, and
we don't know why.
<--------------------->

<d FD00>
It's better for the
both of us that we
work together!
<*********************>

<p 02><d FE00><a 08><n 01>
Thank you! First we
have to help the people
who are injured!
<--------------------->

<p 02><d FF00><a 6B><n 15>
What? Forget about
those Hunters and let's
get back to camp.
<--------------------->

<p 02><d 0001><a 0A><n 01>
No way! I'm not leaving
them! If you don't want
to come, I can go by...
<--------------------->

<p 02><d 0201><a 6B><n 15>
OK, OK, alright
already! For crying out
loud!
<--------------------->

<d 0301>
Why did you have to be
the only one around I
could Megamerge with?
<*********************>

<p 03><d 0401><a 42><n 1F>
...Thanks, you hold on
to Model A. That's
probably safer.
<--------------------->

<p 03><d 0601><a 42><n 1F>
But, I need you to go
to the transerver and
send a mission report.
<--------------------->

<p 03><d 0701><a 42><n 1F>
No mission report
for the client,
no bounty.
<--------------------->

<p 03><d 0801><a 42><n 1F>
Say, we're trying to
fix the train, but we
need a few more parts.
<--------------------->

<p 03><d 0901><a 42><n 1F>
Tell 'em we won't let
'em down, and to wait
just a little longer.
<*********************>

<p 02><d 0A01><a 02><n 00>
So, you're the one who
submitted the mission
report?
<--------------------->

<p 02><d 0B01><a 02><n 00>
I'm connecting your
transerver to Legion's
via a secure channel.
<*********************>

<p 02><d 0C01><a 1D><n 00>
So, you're the
Biometal's Chosen
One... a Mega Man.
<--------------------->

<p 03><d 0D01><a 08><n 01>
...Who are you dudes?
<*********************>

<p 02><d 0F01><a 1C><n 00>
*chuckle* "You dudes,"
huh? I guess you really
have lost your memory.
<*********************>

<p 02><d 1101><a 1E><n 00>
Go easy on him,
Mikhail. He doesn't
know any better.
<*********************>

<p 02><d 1301><a 1D><n 00>
We are called the Sage
Trinity, and we
<--------------------->

<p 02><d 1401><a 1D><n 06>
are the supreme
authority of Legion.
I'm Master Thomas.
<--------------------->

<p 02><d 1501><a 1C><n 07>
And I'm Master Mikhail,
nice to meet you, Mega
Man.
<--------------------->

<p 02><d 1601><a 1E><n 05>
And I am Master Albert.
<--------------------->

<p 02><d 1701><a 1E><n 05>
How do you do, Grey?
<--------------------->

<p 03><d 1801><a 0B><n 01>
How do you know my
name? Have we met
before!?
<--------------------->

<p 02><d 1A01><a 1D><n 06>
Calm down. We know
about you from the
Hunters' report.
<--------------------->

<p 02><d 1B01><a 1D><n 06>
We're running your file
through the Legion
database now.
<--------------------->

<p 02><d 1C01><a 1C><n 07>
We'll soon know who you
really are. Meanwhile,
so you're not just
<--------------------->

<p 02><d 1D01><a 1C><n 07>
sitting around
waiting, we have a
mission for you.
<--------------------->

<p 02><d 1E01><a 1C><n 07>
We'd like you to bring
the Biometal directly
to us.
<*********************>

<p 02><d 2001><a 1E><n 05>
It seems the train
bound for Legion
Headquarters
<--------------------->

<d 2101>
was damaged.
<--------------------->

<p 02><d 2201><a 1E><n 05>
That card key should
allow you access
to a new area.
<--------------------->

<p 02><d 2301><a 1E><n 05>
There's a crashed
Raider airship not far
from you. Find it and
<--------------------->

<p 02><d 2401><a 1E><n 05>
you should be able to
get the parts you need
to repair the train.
<--------------------->

<p 02><d 2501><a 1D><n 06>
The Biometal holds
technology and
information
<--------------------->

<p 02><d 2601><a 1D><n 06>
that we don't fully
understand, like the
M.E.G.A. mechanism
<--------------------->

<d 2701>
which allows you to
Megamerge and become
a Mega Man.
<--------------------->

<p 02><d 2801><a 1C><n 07>
And not to mention
centuries worth of
lost history!
<--------------------->

<p 02><d 2901><a 1E><n 05>
That's enough, Mikhail.
...We have a duty to
study the Biometal
<--------------------->

<p 02><d 2A01><a 1E><n 05>
so its secrets are
never misused. Grey,
can we count on you?
<--------------------->

<p 03><d 2B01><a 08><n 01>
So, if I go to Legion,
you'll tell me about
Model A?
<--------------------->

<p 02><d 2D01><a 1D><n 06>
That is correct. First,
head for the crash
site. Dangers abound,
<--------------------->

<p 02><d 2E01><a 1D><n 06>
so give heed to the 
directions of your 
fellow Hunters.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 6B><n 15>
If you mess around and
hit one of
those things,
<--------------------->

you'll get blown away!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 6B><n 15>
Instead of shooting
them,
<--------------------->

try pressing the Dash
Button to go under 'em.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 6B><n 15>
If you come across a
wall or obstacle that's
too high to jump over,
<--------------------->

try to kick your way
over.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 6B><n 15>
Press the Jump Button
while pressing
<--------------------->

the <dpad>Control Pad in
the direction of the
wall.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 6B><n 15>
It's gonna take more
than one hit to bust
through that!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 6B><n 15>
Try holding down the
Buster Shot Button and
then releasing it.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 6B><n 15>
You can take 'em out
with one shot.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 6B><n 15>
Now, what have we here?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 6B><n 15>
At times like these,
the Homing Shot really
comes in handy.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 6B><n 15>
Try holding down the
Homing Shot Button.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 6B><n 15>
The Homing Shot range
appears in front of
you.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 6B><n 15>
Enemies and any
destructible items in
range
<--------------------->

will be indicated by
markers.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 6B><n 15>
But remember, you can
only home in on up to 8
targets.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 6B><n 15>
Then all you have to do
is release the Homing
Shot Button,
<--------------------->

the rest is automatic.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 6B><n 15>
By the way, you can
customize the controls
<--------------------->

on the Options
sub-screen!
<*********************>

<p 02><a 6B><n 15>
Hey, try pressing up
on the <dpad>Control Pad
while holding down
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 6B><n 15>
the Attack Button and
then releasing it.
You can use this move
<--------------------->

to break objects above
you.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 6B><n 15>
It's a bit advanced,
but I'm sure 
it will come in handy!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 6B><n 15>
And here's another
great trick!

<--------------------->

Hold down and release
the Attack Button
while in mid-air,
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 6B><n 15>
to kick down
towards the ground.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 6B><n 15>
With this move
you can break objects
below you.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 6B><n 15>
Why don't you try these
moves on the two
objects in here!?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 6B><n 15>
If you want to review
them, just press the
START
<--------------------->

and open the
sub-screen. Take a
look in
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 6B><n 15>
the Profiles section.
There, you will find
detailed explanations
<--------------------->

of other
moves as well.
