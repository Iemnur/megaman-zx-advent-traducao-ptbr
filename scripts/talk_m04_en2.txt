<p 02><a 02><n 07>
Can you hear me? It's
me, Mikhail.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 02><n 07>
It looks like you've
stepped into some rough
terrain.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 02><n 07>
You should be able to
cut a path through
the chunks of ice,
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 02><n 07>
but the areas that
allow access to the
crash site are limited.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 02><n 07>
Mega Man, you must find
a way to break through.
<*********************>

<p 03><d 3401><a 2A><n 00>
Prometheus said he
found someone
interesting.
<--------------------->

<d 3501>
I came to see who it
was.
<--------------------->

<p 03><d 3601><a 2A><n 00>
Thetis, she's nothing
more than a kid, like
you.
<*********************>

<p 03><d 3701><a 30><n 00>
Hey, you're not that
much older than me.
<--------------------->

<p 02><d 3801><a 0F><n 02>
W-What is it with you
people!?
<*********************>

<p 03><d 3901><a 31><n 00>
Didn't Prometheus tell
you that you'd meet
other Mega Men?
<--------------------->

<p 03><d 3A01><a 31><n 12>
My name is Thetis, the
Ice Mega Man... Chosen
One for Model L.
<--------------------->

<p 02><d 3B01><a 2B><n 13>
I'm Atlas, the Flame
Mega Man... Chosen One
for Model F.
<--------------------->

<p 02><d 3C01><a 2B><n 13>
How is it that an
unenlightened Hunter
who has no ideals
<--------------------->

<d 3D01>
is a Mega Man?
<--------------------->

<p 02><d 3E01><a 6B><n 15>
What is going on
with all these weirdos?
<--------------------->

<p 02><d 3F01><a 0A><n 02>
I don't need ideals, I
have my pride. I can't
stand people like you
<--------------------->

<d 4001>
who are always looking
down on others.
<*********************>

<p 03><d 4101><a 31><n 12>
Haha, just as I
expected. But...
<--------------------->

<d 4201>
I don't feel like
fighting right now.
<--------------------->

<p 03><d 4301><a 31><n 12>
We've got other things
to do.
<--------------------->

<p 03><d 4401><a 2B><n 13>
I've got no time for
some kid who became a
Mega Man by accident.
<--------------------->

<p 03><d 4501><a 2C><n 13>
You look like you
could use a nice,
cold dip.
<*********************>

<p 03><d 4601><a 37><n 00>
*Ha ha ha* Welcome to
my sub-zero world where
even time freezes!
<--------------------->

<p 03><d 4701><a 37><n 00>
You've got some nerve
calling yourself a Mega
Man, Plebeian!
<--------------------->

<d 4801>
You're nothing more
than a lowlife
commoner!
<--------------------->

<p 03><d 4901><a 37><n 09>
I, Chronoforce will
take that Biometal off
your hands!
<*********************>

<p 03><d 4A01><a 37><n 09>
It looks like you're
not cut out to be a
Mega Man!
<*********************>

<p 03><d 4C01><a 37><n 09>
...You are nothing more
than a pawn in the
palm... of HIS hand.
<--------------------->

<p 03><d 4D01><a 37><n 09>
...All you can hope to
do is just flail about
<--------------------->

<d 4E01>
in the little time you
have left! *cackle*
<*********************>

<p 02><d 4F01><a 0A><n 02>
Do you get the feeling
that those two back
there are just puppets?
<--------------------->

<d 5001>
"HE" is probably
pulling the strings
behind the scenes.
<--------------------->

<p 02><d 5101><a 6B><n 15>
Shoot!... Who do they
think they are,
<--------------------->

<d 5201>
taking advantage of our
ignorance!
<--------------------->

<p 02><d 5301><a 6B><n 15>
Now I want to go all
the way and win this
game even more!
<*********************>

<p 02><a 6B><n 15>
You've got
Chronoforce's power!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 6B><n 15>
Morph into Chronoforce
and you can use Swim in
the water all the time.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 6B><n 15>
Use the <dpad>Control Pad
to move around in the
water, and press the
<--------------------->

Dash Button to propel
yourself quickly
through the current.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 6B><n 15>
Press the Attack Button
to shoot an
ice arrow
<--------------------->

and freeze enemies
solid!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 6B><n 15>
But be careful, on land
you'll become totally
immobile.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 6B><n 15>
Chronoforce's hard
shell protects him from
attacks from above.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 6B><n 15>
Just get under one of
those falling icicles
and see.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 6B><n 15>
Chronoforce's Charge
Attack is awesome!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 6B><n 15>
Hold down the Attack
Button till the meter
is fully charged, 
<--------------------->

then release it to
activate the Time Bomb!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 6B><n 15>
Time Bomb freezes time
for everything around
you,
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 6B><n 15>
and slows down the
movements of enemies.
Cool, huh?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 6B><n 15>
Oh yeah, it's not only
enemies that slow
down...
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 6B><n 15>
You can use Time Bomb
to slow down falling
objects like icicles.
