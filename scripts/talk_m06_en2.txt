<p 02><a 0A><n 02>
Hey! Are you OK?
<--------------------->

<p 03><a 40><n 22>
Ugh... Ug... Help me...
<--------------------->

<p 03><a 40><n 22>
Our airship is under
attack by something
nasty...
<--------------------->

<p 03><a 40><n 22>
It intends to massacre
us all!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 0F><n 02>
A massacre!?
<*********************>

<p 02><a 02><n 06>
This is Master Thomas.
It seems you've arrived
at the crash site.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 02><n 06>
That entire area is an
underground resource
mining facility.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 02><n 06>
If that airship
explodes, it will
<--------------------->

trigger the entire
facility to detonate. 
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 6B><n 15>
He means we're going to
be blown away! C'mon,
let's get outta here!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 0A><n 02>
...The airship is this
way, right?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 6B><n 15>
I don't get it. Those
guys are all Raiders.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 6B><n 15>
Are you sure you want
to help those guys!?
<--------------------->

Technically, they're
your enemies, right?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 0A><n 02>
It doesn't matter who
they are. 
<--------------------->

This is the story of my
life!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 0A><n 02>
I don't want to live my
life with regrets!
<--------------------->

I shouldn't need a
reason to save lives!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 6B><n 15>
OK, OK, if you feel
that strongly about
it...
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 6B><n 15>
You want me to go with
you right? Well let's
go, Ashe!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 02><n 06>
If the airship is
destroyed,
<--------------------->

you won't be able to
recover any of its
parts.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 02><n 06>
Anyway, you have to
prevent the worst from
happening. Hurry, Ashe.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 2A><n 13>
So, those Raiders
escaped through here.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2A><n 13>
Every last one of you
will become nourishment
for Model W!
<*********************>

<p 03><d AE01><a 0A><n 02>
Wait!
<*********************>

<p 02><d AF01><a 2A><n 13>
So you managed to stay
alive, Mega Man
Model A.
<--------------------->

<p 02><d B001><a 2A><n 13>
Don't tell me you're
here to help the
Raiders?
<--------------------->

<d B101>
They're not even your
allies.
<--------------------->

<p 03><d B201><a 08><n 02>
This is also part of
what Hunters do. Heroes
show up just in time.
<--------------------->

<p 02><d B301><a 2A><n 13>
Hmph, you get some
Mega Man power
<--------------------->

<d B401>
and all of a sudden you
think you're a hero.
<--------------------->

<p 02><d B501><a 2A><n 13>
The history of the
world, the history of
the war...
<--------------------->

<d B601>
And now, the strongest
of those

<--------------------->

<d B701>
who evolved as
a product of war
remain.
<--------------------->

<p 02><d B801><a 2A><n 13>
A newly crowned king of
Mega Men will soon
spawn a new evolution.
<--------------------->

<p 02><d B901><a 2A><n 13>
Mega Man's power is the
strength to fight.
<--------------------->

<d BA01>
Those without strength
don't evolve.
<--------------------->

<p 03><d BB01><a 6B><n 15>
So you feed them to
Model W?
<--------------------->

<d BC01>
I'd say that's
pretty barbaric
progress.
<--------------------->

<p 02><d BD01><a 2A><n 13>
What would you know!?
You can't even
comprehend
<--------------------->

<p 02><d BE01><a 2A><n 13>
your own power. If I'm
the one that's wrong,
try and beat me!
<*********************>

<p 03><d BF01><a 2B><n 13>
It is through struggle
that humans learn
discipline and grow!
<--------------------->

<p 03><d C001><a 2C><n 13>
I will be Mega Man
King, for the war that
never ends!
<*********************>

<p 02><d C101><a 2C><n 13>
Aren't you going to
finish me off?
<--------------------->

<p 02><d C201><a 2C><n 13>
Very well. I yield to
you.
<--------------------->

<p 02><d C301><a 2C><n 13>
As long as your
opponent is still
alive, the Game
<--------------------->

<p 02><d C401><a 2C><n 13>
of Destiny isn't over.
One day you'll regret
not finishing me off!
<*********************>

<p 03><d C501><a 0E><n 02>
Aghh! Aaaaarrrr!?
What's happening!?
Model A!
<--------------------->

<p 03><d C601><a 0E><n 02>
Aieghh!
<*********************>

<p 02><a 03><n 00>
EXTRACTING FROM CODE
AW15 TO CE70. EXPANDING
REPORT DATA.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 03><n 00>
......Congratulations.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 03><n 00>
The Model A which I
created is protected by
a cipher
<--------------------->

that is broken only
in battle.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 03><n 00>
You, who broke the
first cipher, 
<--------------------->

are worthy to know its
truth and its power.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 03><n 00>
Through my research of
the lost technology, 
<--------------------->

I have created a key
to unlock the door to
a new evolution.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 03><n 00>
Biometal Model W...  He
who holds it, 
<--------------------->

will hold the power to
rule the world.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 03><n 00>
But it will take much
time before people will
<--------------------->

finally appreciate my
work.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 03><n 00>
Sacrifices are
necessary to awaken
Model W.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 03><n 00>
Model Ws which I have
hidden throughout the
world
<--------------------->

are waiting to be
awakened.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 03><n 00>
Waiting for when the
one who understands my
work appears,
<--------------------->

to receive the power.
<*********************>

<p 03><d C701><a 0E><n 02>
*gulp* ...Model A...
What just happened to
me...
<*********************>

<p 03><d C801><a 6B><n 15>
Was that the data
recorded on me that
those Sage guys
<--------------------->

<p 03><d C901><a 6B><n 15>
were talking about? The
data on the one who
made Model W... and me?
<*********************>

<p 03><d CA01><a 08><n 02>
Are you OK, Model A?
<--------------------->

<p 03><d CB01><a 0A><n 02>
We'd better go help the
others.
<*********************>

<p 03><d CC01><a 41><n 20>
You saved our lives.
Thanks a lot, Sis!
<--------------------->

<p 02><d CD01><a 08><n 02>
Drop the Sis, would
you? I want to use
your airship for
<--------------------->

<d CE01>
parts to repair our
train.
<*********************>

<p 03><d CF01><a 41><n 20>
Aah, it's already been
taken care of. I just
sent some of our guys
<--------------------->

<d D001>
to Hunter's Camp to do
the repairs.
<--------------------->

<p 03><d D101><a 41><n 20>
We were all impressed
with your strength and
courage.
<--------------------->

<p 03><d D201><a 41><n 20>
We're going to clean up
our act and work with
<--------------------->

<d D301>
you as honest to
goodness bounty
Hunters. 
<--------------------->

<p 02><d D401><a 6B><n 15>
*chuckle* It looks like
you have a follower.
<--------------------->

<p 02><d D501><a 6B><n 15>
It's not a bad feeling
to be appreciated.
<--------------------->

<p 03><d D601><a 41><n 20>
The repairs should
almost be finished. Go
back to the camp
<--------------------->

<p 03><d D701><a 41><n 20>
and have a look. I hope
you find out something
at Legion, Sis!
<*********************>

<p 02><d D801><a 41><n 20>
What!? Whoind'heck are
you!
<--------------------->

<p 02><d D901><a 41><n 20>
This shield is made of
ceratanium!
<--------------------->

<p 02><d DA01><a 41><n 20>
Your attacks are
completely useless
against it.
<--------------------->

<d DB01><n 20>
So, why don't you
save yourself the
trouble! Go home!
<*********************>

<p 03><d DC01><a 6B><n 15>
...All this talk is
starting to get really
old.
<--------------------->

<p 03><d DD01><a 6B><n 15>
Yo, morph into that
Atlas lady,
<--------------------->

<d DE01>
and let's hit 'em
hard with a
Charge Attack!
<--------------------->

<p 03><d DF01><a 6B><n 15>
Say goodbye to that
precious shield of
yours!
<*********************>

<p 02><d E001><a 41><n 20>
Waaaagh! P-Please,
d-don't hurt me!
<--------------------->

<p 03><d E101><a 6B><n 15>
I thought so... Just a
buncha wusses!
<--------------------->

<d E201>
Morph back, and let's
set the record
straight...
<*********************>

<p 02><a 6B><n 15>
Atlas can do a lot more
than just that Charge
Attack!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 6B><n 15>
Press the Attack Button

<--------------------->

while holding the
<dpad>Control Pad up to
shoot upwards!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 6B><n 15>
Hold the Attack Button
then release it while
holding the
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 6B><n 15>
<dpad>Control Pad down to
perform the Ground
Breaker move!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 6B><n 15>
You can even change the
trajectory of the
buster shot
<--------------------->

by using the
bottom screen.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 6B><n 15>
You can access that
function by first
selecting "Status" 
<--------------------->

on the sub screen.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 6B><n 15>
Then change the
trajectory by either
touching the boxes
<--------------------->

or using the
<dpad>Control Pad. 
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 6B><n 15>
Select "Exit" to
complete the changes!
<*********************>

<p 02><a 40><n 57>
Are you here to help
us?
<--------------------->

Some of us weren't able
to get out in time.
<--------------------->

They're still trapped
in that room.
<--------------------->

There's something funny
going on with the
power. 
<--------------------->

Some of the doors won't
open...
<--------------------->

Please... All of my
friends are in that
room.
<--------------------->

Please get them out.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 40><n 57>
Thank you! I'll never
forget this.
<*********************>

<p 03><a 40><n 58>
I dunno who you are,
but thank you for
helping me.
<*********************>

<p 03><a 40><n 59>
W-Who are you? Are you
going to hurt me?
Please... No...
<*********************>

<p 03><a 40><n 5A>
Ohhh! Finally, it
opened! Thank you!
<*********************>

<p 02><a 40><n 22>
Please! Help my
friends!
<*********************>

<p 02><a 41><n 20>
I hope you find out
something at Legion!
Good luck!
