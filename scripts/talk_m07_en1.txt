D-Did you hear that!?
What was that loud
noise?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 6B><n 15>
There's a shootout
somewhere.
<--------------------->

I wonder if Mavericks
got the jump on us. I
can't get through 
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 6B><n 15>
to the Sage Trinity.
This doesn't look good.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 08><n 01>
Legion Headquarters is
this way! Let's hurry!

COMMENCING PLAN TO TAKE

<*********************>

<p 03><d F101><a 2E><n 14>

HAZARDOUS TO PROCEED
WITH COMBAT ENGAGEMENT
<--------------------->

<p 03><d F201><a 2E><n 14>

<p 02><d F301><a 0E><n 01>
Aaaaaaaaaah!
<*********************>

<p 02><a 03><n 00>
EXTRACTING FROM CODE
CE71 TO FC60. EXPANDING
REPORT DATA.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 03><n 00>
...You who have broken
the second cipher now
stand at a fateful
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 03><n 00>
crossroads. If you
continue to read this
data,
<--------------------->

there is no turning
back.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 03><n 00>
You too are part of
this plan.
Biometal has the
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 03><n 00>
ability to give its
"Chosen One" superhuman
powers and combine to
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 03><n 00>
become a new lifeform.
This combination
results in a Megamerge,
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 03><n 00>
the transformation into
a Mega Man. I've
decided to select a new
<--------------------->

Chosen One suitable for
Model W, the next step
in evolution.
<--------------------->

Finding a suitable
candidate in this world
is nearly impossible.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 03><n 00>
But I can do it,
because as one of
Legion's Sage Trinity,
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 03><n 00>
I know everything
about the world...
<*********************>

<p 02><d F401><a 0F><n 01>
Model W was created by
one of the Sage
Trinity!?
<--------------------->

<p 02><d F501><a 6B><n 15>
That means that he and
Prometheus are
connected somehow
<--------------------->

<p 02><d F601><a 6B><n 15>
behind the scenes.
And it means that
we can't even
<--------------------->

<d F701>
trust the Sage Trinity.
Yet you still wanna go?
<--------------------->

<p 02><d F801><a 08><n 01>
...Come on, Model A!
They're the only ones
who know about us.
<--------------------->

<p 02><d FA01><a 6B><n 15>
The data recorded on me
is getting more and
more outrageous.
<*********************>

<p 02><d FB01><a 1C><n 07>
I can't stand
Mavericks!
<--------------------->

<p 02><d FC01><a 1D><n 06>
It's hard to believe
that they're
cooperating.
<--------------------->

<p 03><d FD01><a 1E><n 05>
They may be taking
orders from a leader.
<--------------------->

<p 02><d FE01><a 1C><n 07>
What do they want? To
make enemies with every
nation on the planet?
<*********************>

<p 03><d FF01><a 1E><n 05>
What? What if
they're just fed up
with the world.
<--------------------->

<p 02><d 0002><a 1D><n 06>
What?
<*********************>

<p 03><d 0102><a 1E><n 05>
A new rule... For the
evolution of the
ultimate Mega Man...
<*********************>

<p 03><d 0202><a 1E><n 05>
And there's one
scientist
<--------------------->

<d 0302>
who wants to see that
evolution through to
its end.
<*********************>

<p 02><d 0402><a 1C><n 07>
What are you saying!?
No... You didn't!
<*********************>

<p 01><p 03><d 0502><a 1F><n 05>
I have a proposal. A
proposal to this world
I've led for centuries.
<--------------------->

<p 01><p 03><d 0602><a 1F><n 05>
A system to come up
with fair solutions
based on the doctrine
<--------------------->

<p 01><p 03><d 0702><a 20><n 05>
of the Sage Trinity. If
you're opposed, then
just try and stop me.
<*********************>

<p 02><d 0802><a 6B><n 15>
Hey, isn't that
Biometal!?
<*********************>

<p 03><d 0902><a 1F><n 05>
Two of the ciphers have
been broken. I wonder,
just how much
<--------------------->

<p 03><d 0B02><a 1F><n 05>
information has been
compromised? I wanted
to dispose of you
<--------------------->

<d 0C02>
sooner, but things
didn't go exactly
as planned.
<*********************>

<p 02><d 0D02><a 0A><n 01>
YOU are the one who's
been trying to have us
killed!?
<--------------------->

<p 03><d 0E02><a 1F><n 05>
Don't look so angry!
Welcome to Legion.
<--------------------->

<p 03><d 0F02><a 20><n 05>
...Defective.
<*********************>

<p 03><d 1002><a 1D><n 06>
I see. I'll tell you
everything we know.
<--------------------->

<p 03><d 1102><a 1D><n 06>
With these mechanical
bodies, we've been able
to live for centuries.
<--------------------->

<p 03><d 1202><a 1D><n 06>
When Albert became one
of the Sage Trinity
those centuries ago,
<--------------------->

<d 1302>
he was already working
on Model W.
<--------------------->

<p 03><d 1402><a 1D><n 06>
Also, I looked you up
in our database, Grey.
<*********************>

<p 02><d 1502><a 0F><n 01>
And what did you
find out about me!?
<--------------------->

<p 03><d 1602><a 1D><n 06>
Well, there was no data
on you... It appears
that you never existed.
<--------------------->

<p 02><d 1702><a 0B><n 01>
That's ridiculous!
You're lying!
<--------------------->

<p 03><d 1802><a 1D><n 06>
I'm not sure what you
are... But Albert said
that you were made
<--------------------->

<p 03><d 1902><a 1D><n 06>
in his image. I'm
afraid that because you
showed up,
<--------------------->

<p 03><d 1A02><a 1D><n 06>
he had to speed up his
plan. I'm not exactly
sure why, though.
<*********************>

<p 02><d 1C02><a 0D><n 01>
I come all this way, go
through all of that,
almost get killed,
<--------------------->

<d 1D02>
and all you can tell me
is that you don't know
anything?
<--------------------->

<p 02><d 1E02><a 6B><n 15>
...*sigh*
<*********************>

<p 03><d 1F02><a 1C><n 07>
Gentlemen, bad news. We
have Mavericks showing
up all over the world.
<--------------------->

<p 03><d 2002><a 1C><n 07>
Albert has started
hunting for food for
his Model W.
<--------------------->

<p 02><d 2102><a 6B><n 15>
He knows the jig is up!
He's going for a Hail
Mary! Let's go, Grey!
<--------------------->

<p 02><d 2202><a 0D><n 01>
But... I...
<--------------------->

<p 02><d 2302><a 6B><n 15>
C'mon, let's go make
Albert tell us 
everything he knows.
<--------------------->

<p 02><d 2402><a 6B><n 15>
And yeah, we
can do heroic rescues
along the way!
<--------------------->

<p 02><d 2502><a 0D><n 01>
I can't... I don't
know anything about
myself or the world.
<--------------------->

<p 02><d 2602><a 0D><n 01>
How can I stand up to
Albert, who knows
everything...
<*********************>

<p 03><d 2702><a 6B><n 15>
But I know you!
<--------------------->

<p 03><d 2802><a 6B><n 15>
You're a tough-talking
stubborn kid who helps
people he doesn't know
<--------------------->

<p 03><d 2A02><a 6B><n 15>
without expecting
anything in return. A
kind, crazy fool!
<--------------------->

<p 02><d 2B02><a 08><n 01>
...!
<--------------------->

<p 03><d 2C02><a 6B><n 15>
Are you just gonna let
people suffer? Some
conscience you have!
<--------------------->

<p 03><d 2E02><a 6B><n 15>
What happened to "I
shouldn't need a
reason to save lives"?
<--------------------->

<p 02><d 3002><a 0A><n 01>
You're right, there's
still something I can
do... Let's go Model A!
<*********************>

<p 02><d 3202><a 0B><n 01>
Maybe we can't win,
<--------------------->

<d 3302>
but we're the only ones
who stand a chance of
beating Albert!
<*********************>

<p 03><d 3402><a 1D><n 06>
Thank you, Grey. I'd
like you to go on
another mission.
<--------------------->

<p 03><d 3502><a 1D><n 06>
I want you to stop
Albert's plan and save
our world.
<--------------------->

<p 03><d 3602><a 1D><n 06>
I've added new
transport destinations
to the transerver.
<--------------------->

<d 3702>
...I'm counting on you.
<*********************>

<p 03><a 1D><n 06>
There are 4 new
transport destinations.
The transerver is
<--------------------->

located just past the
elevator when you exit
the door on the right.
<*********************>

<p 03><a 1C><n 07>
Albert is a terrifying
fellow.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 6B><n 15>
What is this place? I
can't see a thing in
here!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 6B><n 15>
Try morphing into
Siarnaq. Maybe that'll
help.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 6B><n 15>
Touch the Siarnaq icon
on lower right of the
bottom screen,
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 6B><n 15>
The bottom screen will
change into a radar
scope.
<--------------------->

You'll be able to see
the landscape and enemy
positions!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 6B><n 15>
You should be able to
attack enemies by
touching
<--------------------->

their location
indicators on the
bottom screen.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 6B><n 15>
But unfortunately,
there's no way out of
this room...
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 6B><n 15>
I know!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 6B><n 15>
Jump and press up on
the <dpad>Control Pad. With
Siarnaq's ability,
<--------------------->

you should be able
to grab onto that
contraption.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 6B><n 15>
Give it a try. Just
press up on the
<dpad>Control Pad while
<--------------------->

you're in mid-jump!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 6B><n 15>
Depending on what
you've grabbed onto,
you can press
<--------------------->

the <dpad>Control Pad up
twice quickly to jump
on top of it.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 6B><n 15>
You can also press the
<dpad>Control Pad down
twice quickly to hang.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 6B><n 15>
Hold the Attack Button
and release it to throw
a Cross Star!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 6B><n 15>
If there's something
you don't quite
understand,
<--------------------->

just take a look at
Profile on the
sub screen!
