<p 02><a 02><n 07>
There are people being
chased by Mavericks on
that Highway ahead.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 02><n 07>
It looks like all the
people trying to flee
in their cars have
<--------------------->

caused a traffic jam.
The situation is
gridlock. Drive back
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 02><n 07>
the Mavericks and buy
time for the people
down there to escape.
<*********************>

<p 03><a 6A><n 56>
Hey, move it! We're
sitting ducks here!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 0A><n 02>
Leave the Mavericks to
me!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 0B><n 02>
When it's clear, I want
you to go!
<--------------------->

<p 03><a 6A><n 56>
I don't know who you
are, but thank you!
<--------------------->

<p 03><a 6A><n 56>
There are still cars
stopped back there!
They need your help!
<*********************>

<p 02><a 6B><n 15>
It looks like the
people made it through.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 08><n 02>
OK, now all we have to
do is hold off the
pursuing Mavericks.
<*********************>

<p 02><d 7602><a 0A><n 02>
Thetis! Are you the one
causing all of this
trouble?
<*********************>

<p 03><d 7702><a 30><n 12>
I'm flattered. You
remembered my name!
<*********************>

<p 03><d 7802><a 31><n 12>
Come, there's something
I want to show you.
<*********************>

<p 02><d 7902><a 6B><n 15>
Model W!? You attacked
the Highway to feed
that thing!?
<--------------------->

<p 03><d 7A02><a 31><n 12>
That's right. But what
I want to show you is
further down...
<--------------------->

<d 7B02>
At the bottom of this
dirty sea.
<--------------------->

<p 03><d 7C02><a 31><n 12>
The sea during the war
was no place for living
creatures. 
<--------------------->

<p 03><d 7D02><a 32><n 12>
After the war, the
sea's beauty was
restored.
<--------------------->

<d 7E02>
However, as humans
repopulated, the sea
once again grew filthy.
<--------------------->

<p 03><d 7F02><a 32><n 12>
You see, humans have to
desecrate the Earth to
live on it.
<--------------------->

<p 02><d 8002><a 0A><n 02>
You talk all high and
mighty,
<--------------------->

<d 8102>
but what you're
doing is no different
than a Maverick.
<--------------------->

<p 03><d 8202><a 31><n 12>
*chuckle* Me?
A Maverick? You are
a funny girl...
<--------------------->

<p 03><d 8402><a 31><n 12>
We were planning on
playing this little
Game of Destiny
<--------------------->

<d 8502>
to decide the Mega Man
King by ourselves.
<--------------------->

<p 03><d 8602><a 31><n 12>
You're the one that
just happened to
Megamerge, then show up
<--------------------->

<d 8702>
and be a nuisance... so
I'd say that kind of
makes YOU a Maverick!
<*********************>

<p 03><d 8802><a 31><n 12>
Just preserving life is
not what's right.
<--------------------->

<p 03><d 8902><a 31><n 12>
Fix the ones that can
be fixed and abandon
the rest!
<*********************>

<p 03><d 8A02><a 32><n 12>
It's too bad... I
thought you, at least,
<--------------------->

<d 8B02>
would understand
what I'm trying to 
accomplish!
<--------------------->

<p 03><d 8C02><a 32><n 12>
I won't give up. I
shall awaken Model W
<--------------------->

<d 8D02>
and change this world
for the better!
<*********************>

<p 02><d 8E02><a 0E><n 02>
Aaaagh!
<*********************>

<p 01><p 02><a 03><n 00>
EXTRACTING FROM CODE
FC61 TO UC79. EXPANDING
REPORT DATA.
<--------------------->

<p 01><p 02><a 03><n 00>
In order to find a
Biomatch for Biometal
Model W,
<--------------------->

<p 01><p 02><a 03><n 00>
first I created sibling
Reploids.
<*********************>

<p 01><p 02><a 03><n 00>
As well as giving them
a portion of Model W's
power,
<--------------------->

I gave them 1
commandment.
<--------------------->

<p 01><p 02><a 03><n 00>
That was to deterimine
the most powerful
Mega Man.
<--------------------->

<p 01><p 02><a 03><n 00>
A commandment to
Biomatch each of my
Chosen Ones
<--------------------->

to a Biometal.
<--------------------->

<p 01><p 02><a 03><n 00>
And have them fight
until only one of them
was left.
<--------------------->

<p 01><p 02><a 03><n 00>
The survivor of this
contest will attain the
power of Model W,
<--------------------->

and become the ultimate
Mega Man.
<--------------------->

<p 01><p 02><a 03><n 00>
Yes, the new King of
the world, the Mega Man
King.
<*********************>

<p 00><p 02><d 8F02><a 6B><n 15>
We broke another
cipher.
<--------------------->

<p 02><d 9002><a 6B><n 15>
Now I understand why
Mega Men fight each
other.
<--------------------->

<d 9102>
But where is the
information about us?
<--------------------->

<p 02><d 9202><a 6B><n 15>
And what the heck are
the two Reploid
siblings?
<--------------------->

<p 02><d 9302><a 0D><n 02>
...
<--------------------->

<p 02><d 9402><a 6B><n 15>
Hey, can you hear me?
What happened? Why
the frown?
<--------------------->

<p 02><d 9502><a 08><n 02>
Uh? It's nothing...
<*********************>

<p 02><d 9602><a 02><n 07>
It seems you got
everyone out of there
safely.
<--------------------->

<p 02><d 9702><a 02><n 07>
Just what we'd expect
from a Chosen One.
<--------------------->

<p 02><d 9802><a 0D><n 02>
(Chosen One...? But
like Thetis said,)
<--------------------->

<d 9902>
(my Megamerging was an
accident.)
<--------------------->

<p 02><d 9A02><a 0D><n 02>
(But... was it an
accident? Albert said
that I'm special...)
<--------------------->

<p 02><d 9B02><a 0D><n 02>
(What am I... Who am
I?)
<*********************>

<p 02><a 6B><n 15>
Hey, Ashe! Morph into
Thetis and water
becomes your home.
<--------------------->

You can swim around
freely underwater.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 6B><n 15>
Underwater, press the
Jump Button once
<--------------------->

to get into your
swimming position!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 6B><n 15>
Then, you can move
around by using the
<dpad>Control Pad.
<--------------------->

You can dart through
the water by pressing
the Dash Button!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 6B><n 15>
Hold the Attack Button
and release it to
perform an ice move.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 6B><n 15>
Ice attacks can
penetrate the
landscape,
<--------------------->

so that's probably a
good thing to remember.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 6B><n 15>
Also, Thetis has the
ability
<--------------------->

to show where items are
located on the bottom
screen!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 6B><n 15>
If you're somewhere
you're not sure about,
<--------------------->

morph into Thetis to
find items!
