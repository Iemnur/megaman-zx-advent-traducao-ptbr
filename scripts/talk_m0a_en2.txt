<p 02><a 0F><n 02>
Aagh! The ground...!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 0E><n 02>
Aaaagh!
<*********************>

<p 02><a 0A><n 02>
Phew... It stopped...
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 6B><n 15>
The ground is floating!
What's going on?
<*********************>

<p 02><a 02><n 06>
Are you alright? That
area is experiencing a
gravitational anomaly.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 02><n 06>
Also, powerful energy
reactions have been
discovered.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 02><n 06>
In all likelihood they
are the cause of the
gravitational anomaly.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 02><n 06>
Proceed to investigate
the energy reactions.
<*********************>

<p 02><d A402><a 0F><n 02>
What's a Model W doing
here!?
<--------------------->

<p 02><d A502><a 6B><n 15>
Could this be the
source of the
gravitational anomaly!?
<*********************>

<p 03><d A602><a 33><n 11>
Inescapable destiny...
So, you came, Mega Man
Model A.
<--------------------->

<p 03><d A702><a 33><n 11>
But I'll be taking
the Model W.
<--------------------->

<p 02><d A802><a 0A><n 02>
Aeolus! What are you
doing collecting all
those Model Ws!?
<--------------------->

<p 03><d A902><a 33><n 11>
That's a silly
question... You call
yourself a Mega Man,
<--------------------->

<d AA02>
yet you don't even know
the significance of
Model W...
<--------------------->

<p 03><d AB02><a 33><n 11>
You fear what you don't
understand,
<--------------------->

<d AC02>
and eliminate what you
fear...
<--------------------->

<p 03><d AD02><a 33><n 11>
It's because of foolish
people like you that
there is conflict.
<--------------------->

<p 02><d AE02><a 6B><n 15>
I don't know what all
of that ideological
babble was about,
<--------------------->

<p 02><d AF02><a 6B><n 15>
but it sounded a lot
like a threat.
<--------------------->

<p 03><d B002><a 33><n 11>
So it is. In the world
I have in mind, there
is no place
<--------------------->

<d B102>
for idiots like you,
Mega Man Model A!
<--------------------->

<p 03><d B202><a 33><n 11>
Your time's up fool!
<*********************>

<p 03><d B302><a 34><n 11>
Complete victory...
A fool has no right to
rule!
<*********************>

<p 03><d B502><a 35><n 11>
A woeful
miscalculation...!
<--------------------->

<d B602>
To think that I could
be bested by a
plebeian!
<--------------------->

<p 03><d B702><a 35><n 11>
I'll never acknowledge
one as ignorant as you,
Mega Man!
<--------------------->

<p 03><d B802><a 35><n 11>
Your time's up fool! I
will right this world's
wrongs!
<*********************>

<p 02><d B902><a 0E><n 02>
Aaaagh!
<*********************>

<p 02><a 03><n 00>
EXTRACTING FROM CODE
UC80 TO AC195.
EXPANDING REPORT DATA.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 03><n 00>
The power of Biometal
isn't something to be
had by just anyone.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 03><n 00>
It's a power which
should only be obtained
by a Chosen One,
<--------------------->

one with the ability to
change the world.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 03><n 00>
I devised this cipher
to lock away the power
of the Biometal.
<*********************>

<p 01><p 02><a 03><n 00>
A cipher that would
allow only the Chosen
One
<--------------------->

to unleash its power. 
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 03><n 00>
In other words, it's
locked to its
Biomatch.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 03><n 00>
All Humans who get a
bionic body
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 03><n 00>
have to come to Legion
for inspection.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 03><n 00>
I made sure that every
bionic body part I
inspected 
<--------------------->

was infused with my
DNA.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 03><n 00>
That is the key to the
cipher, the proof of
being the Chosen One.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 03><n 00>
Yes, by viewing this
data, you now have 
within you my DNA.
<*********************>

<p 00><p 02><d BA02><a 6B><n 15>
...Who IS this guy?
<--------------------->

<p 02><d BB02><a 0F><n 02>
So I'm a blood relative
of Albert?
<--------------------->

<p 02><d BC02><a 6B><n 15>
I know it's not easy,
but don't let it get
to you.
<--------------------->

<p 02><d BD02><a 6B><n 15>
That's just some label
Albert made up. Try not
to think about it.
<--------------------->

<p 02><d BE02><a 0D><n 02>
Uh... yeah...
<--------------------->

<p 02><d BF02><a 6B><n 15>
That Albert guy just
used his position as
one of the Sage Trinity
<--------------------->

<d C002>
to do whatever he
wanted.
<*********************>

<p 02><d C102><a 02><n 06>
It's true that Albert
knew more about
technology than anyone.
<--------------------->

<p 02><d C202><a 02><n 06>
But we had no idea
that was the kind of
man he was.
<--------------------->

<d C302>
We should have known
better.
<--------------------->

<p 02><d C402><a 0A><n 02>
It's OK. I was kinda
prepared for it. But if
it's only a matter
<--------------------->

<d C502>
of becoming a Mega Man,
then I'm no different
from Aeolus.
<--------------------->

<p 02><d C602><a 0A><n 02>
There must be a reason
that Albert treats me
special...
<--------------------->

<p 02><d C802><a 6B><n 15>
I guess the only one
who knows that... is
Albert.
<--------------------->

<p 02><d C902><a 02><n 06>
The gravity in the area
should normalize
momentarily.
<--------------------->

<d CA02>
Head to the next
destination.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 6B><n 15>
It seems that you can
Air Dash using Aeolus.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 6B><n 15>
If you hit the Dash
Button in mid air,
<--------------------->

it looks like you can
get some horizontal
hang time.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 6B><n 15>
If you hold the
<dpad>Control Pad up
<--------------------->

and press the Dash
Button in mid air,
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 6B><n 15>
you can Air Dash
straight up.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 6B><n 15>
Air Dash doesn't reduce
your BM gauge.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 6B><n 15>
If you press the Jump
Button in mid air, 
<--------------------->

you can hover.
(You can modify this
in the Options menu.)
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 6B><n 15>
Hold down the Attack
Button and then release
it
<--------------------->

to perform an electric
move!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 6B><n 15>
These electric attacks
penetrate through the
landscape,
<--------------------->

so you can use them to
attack enemies behind
walls.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 6B><n 15>
Also, Aeolus has the
ability to check an
enemy's data
<--------------------->

on the bottom screen.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 6B><n 15>
Knowing an enemy's
weakness, now that's
an ability you can use!
