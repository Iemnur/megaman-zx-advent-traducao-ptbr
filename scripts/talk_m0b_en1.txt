<p 02><a 6B><n 15>
What is this place?
There's junk
everywhere.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 02><n 07>
That's a Scrapyard.
There are mountains of
discarded machines.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 02><n 07>
Until only recently
they were all buried in
the snow. Imagine that!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 08><n 01>
I don't see any snow.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 02><n 07>
The heat from the
machines melted it all.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 02><n 07>
Machines that were
thrown away because
they were supposedly
<--------------------->

broken became Mavericks
and started working
again.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 6B><n 15>
Scrap that just starts
working again!?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 02><n 07>
That's the reason I had
you two come here.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 02><n 07>
Whoever is controlling
the scrap should be
here too.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 02><n 07>
Take him down and scrap
the Mavericks.
<*********************>

<p 03><d D602><a 38><n 00>
I see you pushed your
way through all of
those Mavericks
<--------------------->

<d D702>
to get a special front
row seat to watch me
perform.
<--------------------->

<p 03><d D802><a 38><n 00>
That's pretty Mega of
you, Mega Man Model A.
<--------------------->

<p 03><d D902><a 38><n 0B>
I'm Vulturon. I play
the part of the prince
<--------------------->

<d DA02>
who kisses Model Ws and
wakes them up!
<--------------------->

<p 02><d DB02><a 0F><n 01>
Model Ws!? Are they in
there?
<--------------------->

<p 03><d DC02><a 38><n 0B>
Not so fast, that's
where the VIP seats
are.
<--------------------->

<d DD02>
I'm afraid you can't go
in there.
<--------------------->

<p 03><d DE02><a 38><n 0B>
What do you say we
start the show?
<--------------------->

<d DF02>
I'll play guitar, and
you'll sing the vocals.
<--------------------->

<p 03><d E002><a 38><n 0B>
I'm looking forward to
the finale
<--------------------->

<d E102>
as you scream your last
breath!
<*********************>

<p 03><d E202><a 38><n 0B>
Bravo, bravo! Now that
was a real Mega death!
<*********************>

<p 03><d E302><a 38><n 0B>
What! This was supposed
to be Mega's death
concert, not mine!
<--------------------->

<p 03><d E402><a 38><n 0B>
Aaaaagggg!
<*********************>

<p 03><d E502><a 28><n 04>
I hear it...
<--------------------->

<p 03><d E602><a 28><n 04>
The discarded
machines... the
Mechaniloids...
<--------------------->

<d E702>
Their voices of
sadness... of pain...
of anger...
<--------------------->

<p 03><d E802><a 28><n 04>
All food for Model W.
<--------------------->

<p 02><d E902><a 0A><n 01>
Pandora!
<--------------------->

<p 03><d EA02><a 28><n 04>
Can you not hear it...?
<--------------------->

<d EB02>
The cries of this
world... of this
planet...?
<--------------------->

<p 02><d EC02><a 0A><n 01>
Of course I hear it!
How could I not!?
<--------------------->

<p 02><d ED02><a 0B><n 01>
And you always seem
to be at the center of
those screams.
<--------------------->

<p 03><d EE02><a 28><n 04>
That's not so...
<--------------------->

<p 02><d EF02><a 0A><n 01>
W-What?
<--------------------->

<p 03><d F002><a 28><n 04>
Those screams... are
because of you and
that Albert fellow...
<*********************>

<p 03><d F102><a 28><n 04>
Even as you awoke...
destiny had already
been set in motion.
<--------------------->

<p 02><d F202><a 6B><n 15>
What the heck are you
talking about?
<--------------------->

<p 03><d F302><a 28><n 04>
The time will come...
when you shall know
everything.
<--------------------->

<d F402>
And you will be driven
to despair...
<*********************>

<p 02><d F502><a 0A><n 01>
I'll know everything?
Driven to despair?
What was that about?
<*********************>

<p 02><d F602><a 02><n 07>
Hmph... She took
Model W with her.
She's definitely odd.
<--------------------->

<p 02><d F702><a 02><n 07>
Good work. The
Mavericks in that area
<--------------------->

<d F802>
seem to be settling
down.
<--------------------->

<p 02><d F902><a 02><n 07>
Mission accomplished.
Don't forget to submit
a report.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 6B><n 15>
What the...? Somebody's
done something to this
room.
<--------------------->

How are you supposed
get past that?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 6B><n 15>
Yes, I know! You can
morph into Vulturon
and use his ability!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 6B><n 15>
Vulturon can scale
walls.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 6B><n 15>
You should be able to
grab onto that
counterweight
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 6B><n 15>
and pull it down.
Vulturon can also
hover.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 6B><n 15>
To use hover, press and
hold the Jump Button in
mid air.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 6B><n 15>
It looks like it uses
up some of your BM
gauge, though.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 6B><n 15>
In other words, be
careful hovering for
long periods of time!
