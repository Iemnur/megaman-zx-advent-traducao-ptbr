<p 02><a 08><n 01>
...Where am I?
<*********************>

<p 03><a 08><n 01>
I remember this place.
This is the building I
first woke up in...
<--------------------->

<p 03><a 6B><n 15>
You were locked up
here?
<*********************>

<p 02><a 02><n 06>
If this is where you
received your Mega Man
preparation,
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 02><n 06>
there may be a clue
about Albert's plan.
Would you have a look?
<*********************>

<p 02><a 08><n 01>
I don't think I've been
in this building
though...
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 6B><n 15>
OK, let's go check it
out!
<*********************>

<p 02><d CA03><a 08><n 01>
This is just like the
capsule I was in...
<--------------------->

<p 02><d CB03><a 6B><n 15>
Look at that panel.
There's a message.
<*********************>

<p 02><d CC03><a 04><n 00>
DAN-001 "PROMETHEUS"
TIME REMAINING BEFORE
SHUTDOWN FOR
<--------------------->

<d CD03>
RECALIBRATION 246924
SECONDS.
<*********************>

<p 02><d CE03><a 04><n 00>
DAN-002 "PANDORA"
TIME REMAINING BEFORE
SHUTDOWN FOR
<--------------------->

<d CF03>
RECALIBRATION 246939
SECONDS.
<*********************>

<p 02><d D003><a 0F><n 01>
These are Prometheus
and Pandora's capsules!
<--------------------->

<d D103>
Those two were made
here too?
<*********************>

<p 02><d D203><a 6B><n 15>
Maybe they're what
the data meant by 
"Reploid siblings."
<--------------------->

<p 02><d D303><a 6B><n 15>
I bet the first two
Mega Men Albert made
<--------------------->

<d D403>
were Prometheus and
Pandora.
<--------------------->

<p 02><d D503><a 0F><n 01>
...!
<*********************>

<p 02><d D603><a 02><n 06>
There's no doubt about
it.
<--------------------->

<d D703>
These capsules are the
chains that bound them.
<--------------------->

<p 02><d D803><a 02><n 06>
So that they wouldn't
go against Albert's
plan.
<--------------------->

<p 02><d D903><a 08><n 01>
Chains?
<--------------------->

<p 02><d DA03><a 02><n 06>
The counter on the
panel is probably
Prometheus's life.
<--------------------->

<d DB03>
It's set pretty short.
They're made so that
they'll die
<--------------------->

<p 02><d DC03><a 02><n 06>
if they don't go back
into the capsules for
maintenance
<--------------------->

<d DD03>
at regular intervals.
<--------------------->

<p 02><d DE03><a 6B><n 15>
In order to stay
maintained, they have
to do what Albert says.
<--------------------->

<p 02><d DF03><a 02><n 06>
It looks like this
building goes further
in.
<--------------------->

<p 02><d E003><a 02><n 06>
There may be something
left. Keep looking.
<*********************>

<p 03><d E103><a 3D><n 00>
Hey, hey, that's as far
as you go!
<--------------------->

<p 03><d E203><a 3D><n 00>
Nobody gets past this
point!
<--------------------->

<d E303>
I'm just following Mr.
Albert's orders.
<--------------------->

<p 02><d E403><a 0B><n 01>
So he's hiding
something in here too!
<--------------------->

<d E503>
Well you're just gonna
have to get out of the
way!
<--------------------->

<p 03><d E603><a 3D><n 0F>
Hey, hey! Do you think
you can just ignore me,
Hedgeshock!?
<--------------------->

<p 03><d E703><a 3D><n 0F>
You've got to face the
penalty! A shocking
penalty!
<--------------------->

<p 03><d E803><a 3D><n 0F>
Mr. Albert's orders are
absolute!
<*********************>

<p 03><d E903><a 3D><n 0F>
That's right! I am a
faithful servant of Mr.
Albert!
<*********************>

<p 03><d EA03><a 3D><n 0F>
Hey, hey! That kind of
strength... is...
cheating!
<--------------------->

<p 03><d EB03><a 3D><n 0F>
It's just like... 
Mr. Albert's strength!
<--------------------->

<p 03><d EC03><a 3D><n 0F>
WAAAAAH!
<*********************>

<p 02><d ED03><a 08><n 01>
Is there only this one
capsule?
<--------------------->

<p 02><d EE03><a 6B><n 15>
But it's empty. There's
something showing on
this panel, though.
<*********************>

<p 02><d EF03><a 04><n 00>
DAN-000 <74>PROTOTYPE<74>
FINAL VERSION COMPLETE.
START FINAL PHASE.
<--------------------->

<p 03><d F003><a 0F><n 01>
There were Mega Men
being made even before
Prometheus and Pandora?
<--------------------->

<p 03><d F103><a 0F><n 01>
The process is finished
and the capsule is
open...
<--------------------->

<p 03><d F203><a 6B><n 15>
Huh? There's a disk
still in this drive!
<*********************>

<p 02><d F303><a 02><n 06>
Very good, but all
you managed to find
<--------------------->

<d F403>
is an empty capsule and
some incomplete data?
<--------------------->

<p 02><d F503><a 02><n 06>
There might be some
Mega Men that we don't
know about.
<--------------------->

<p 02><d F603><a 02><n 06>
We'll analyze the data
here and see what we
can find.
<--------------------->

<d F703>
Send it with your
mission report.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 6B><n 15>
The passage up ahead is
really low.
<--------------------->

Crouching looks like
the only way to get in.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 6B><n 15>
But, with these
obstacles in the way,
<--------------------->

we can't get all the
way through.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 6B><n 15>
I've got it! Try
morphing into
Hedgeshock!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 6B><n 15>
Then, hold down the
<dpad>Control Pad and press
Dash.
<--------------------->

That way you can
slip under! 
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 6B><n 15>
Hedgeshock's abilities
aren't very good on the
offensive,
<--------------------->

so you should avoid
using her against
enemies.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 6B><n 15>
You can shoot balls of
electricity by holding
down the Attack Button
<--------------------->

and releasing it!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 6B><n 15>
Well come on, let's
use rolling dash to get
into that passageway.
