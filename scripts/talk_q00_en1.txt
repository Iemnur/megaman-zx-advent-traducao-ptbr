It looks like one of
the passengers forgot
this backpack.
<--------------------->

If you're going back to
Hunter's Camp,
<--------------------->

would you mind
returning it to its
owner for me?
<*********************>

<p 02><a 42><n 4D>
I seem to recall he was
a chubby boy with
glasses.
<--------------------->

He walked off that way
towards Hunter's Camp,
<--------------------->

so he shouldn't be hard
to find.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 42><n 4D>
Were you able to give
the backpack to him?
That's great. Thanks.
<--------------------->

Huh? He wants me to
have this disk just for
finding that backpack?
<--------------------->

I don't even have the
equipment to analyze
it. Here, you keep it?
<*********************>

<p 02><a 4B><n 45>
I wonder where my
backpack went?
<--------------------->

Oh! Would that, by any
chance, be my backpack?
<--------------------->

I have a lot of
important things in
there.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 4B><n 45>
Thank you!
<--------------------->

I want to give Patrick
something for finding
my backpack for me.
<--------------------->

But I'm broke because
yesterday I spent all
my money on comics.
<--------------------->

By the way! Give him
this disk for me.
<--------------------->

It's special because it
contains a comic of my
favorite superhero!
<*********************>

<p 02><a 4B><n 45>
Be sure to tell Patrick
that comic disk is from
me!
