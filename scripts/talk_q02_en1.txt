I'm going to need
another 100 EC...

I hit some pretty tough
bedrock down there.
<--------------------->

My drill is pretty much
useless on it.
<--------------------->

I've heard talk of
there being a Legendary
Pickaxe
<--------------------->

made of Ceratanium
somewhere in the
Quarries.
<--------------------->

Do you think you could
find it for me? I'd
really appreciate it.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 5F><n 33>
They say that the
Legendary Pickaxe is in
the dark cellar.
<--------------------->

It's probably somewhere
in the Quarries.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 5F><n 33>
Oh! I didn't think
you'd really be able to
find it!
<--------------------->

With this, I should be
able to keep digging.
<--------------------->

Well, I'll get back to
work. Come back again,
OK?
<*********************>

<p 02><a 5F><n 33>
Boy, I'm surprised that
I was even able to dig
this far!
<--------------------->

Of course I couldn't
have done it without
your help.

I'm glad you want to
help, but that's just
not enough E-Crystals.
