<p 02><a 4A><n 40>
Oh... what am I going
to do?
<--------------------->

I caught a Moth Queen
but it got away...
<--------------------->

Aah... won't someone
catch it for me?
*wink*
<*********************>

<p 02><a 4A><n 40>
I'd have to able to fly
to reach way up
there...
<--------------------->

I bet a Hunter would be
able to catch it for
me... *wink*
<*********************>

<p 02><a 4A><n 40>
My Moth Queen... you
caught it for me!
<--------------------->

You ARE a Hunter!
Oh, thank you!
<--------------------->

I'm so glad you came to
my aid! It isn't
much...
<--------------------->

but I want you to have
this.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 4A><n 40>
They say Moth Queens
are popular with
celebrities
<--------------------->

because they're so
beautiful.
<--------------------->

I'm going to sell these
beauties to earn enough
money 
<--------------------->

to become a Hunter
someday.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 4A><n 40>
It's really cold here.
<--------------------->

This hood, I usually
just wear it because it
looks cute...
<--------------------->

But it's nice to have
on days like this.
<--------------------->

And, it's good for
hearing far-away
sounds.
