<p 02><a 42><n 4C>
Oh, no!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 42><n 4C>
We've just gotten
confirmation
<--------------------->

of Mechaniloid activity
in the air!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 42><n 4C>
It's only a matter of
time before they'll be
coming after
<--------------------->

our underground energy
stores.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 42><n 4C>
I don't have enough
firepower to take 'em
on.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 42><n 4C>
I need you to go and
protect the energy
stores.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 42><n 4C>
There are 3 on the left
side, straight ahead.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 42><n 4C>
I'm begging you, please
don't let them get to
those energy stores!
<*********************>

<e 01><a 42><n 4C>
Accept this mission?
  Yes
  No
<*********************>

<p 02><a 42><n 4C>
Thank you. There'll be
a reward for you if you
can pull it off.
<*********************>

<p 02><s 01><a 42><n 4C>
I guess it's too much
to ask even of you...
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 42><n 4C>
Dang... I guess the
only thing left to do
is pray
<--------------------->

that the Mechaniloids
don't come.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 42><n 4C>
We're still picking up
on some Mechaniloid
activity.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 42><n 4C>
Thank you. I never
doubted that you'd come
through!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 42><n 4C>
Here's your reward. 
300 EC.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 42><n 4C>
Thank you. At least you
managed to save 2.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 42><n 4C>
Here's your reward. 
200 EC.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 42><n 4C>
Thank you. At least you
managed to save 1.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 42><n 4C>
Here's your reward. 
100 EC.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 42><n 4C>
I guess it was too
tough even for you...
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 42><n 4C>
I'm so sorry I asked
you to go on such an
impossible mission.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 42><n 4C>
My name is George. As
you can see, I'm a
Hunter.
<--------------------->

Now I'm waiting for
energy stores to
arrive.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 42><n 4C>
We're expecting 
3 units.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 42><n 4C>
Mechaniloids can sniff
out energy from miles
away.
<--------------------->

So, when moving energy
stores around, we have
to be very careful.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 42><n 4C>
Especially now that
Mavericks seem to be
turning up everywhere.
<--------------------->

We're constantly on the
lookout.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 42><n 4C>
I never seriously
thought Mechaniloids
would actually show up.
