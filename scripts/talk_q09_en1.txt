Hey, you. Can I ask you
to do something for me?
<--------------------->

I lost a wrench
somewhere in this room.
<--------------------->

Would you help me look
for it? I'll hook you
up later.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 42><n 4B>
Hm? You can't climb
walls 'cause it's too
dangerous?
<--------------------->

Do you see those places
on the wall that stick
out?
<--------------------->

Use those to help you
scale the wall little
by little.
<--------------------->

There's really no point
if you can't manage to
hold on
<--------------------->

a little better.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 42><n 4B>
Yeeeah! That's it!
That's my wrench!
<--------------------->

Heh-Heh, I guess I owe
you one. Here you go.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 42><n 4B>
But listen, if I
give you this,
<--------------------->

you can't tell anyone
that I lost my wrench,
got it?
<--------------------->

If the guys I work
with found out, it'd be
a total embarrassment.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 42><n 4B>
The wrench you brought
me was the new wrench I
had just bought.
<--------------------->

As soon as I got it, I
went around and showed
it off to everyone.
<--------------------->

And then I lost it.
<--------------------->

I guess it serves me
right, but it's not
cool.
<--------------------->

You know where I'm
coming from, right?
<--------------------->

Anyway, thanks to you,
I got it back!
