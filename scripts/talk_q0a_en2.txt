<p 02><a 51><n 41>
The many inventions
left to us by our
forefathers,
<--------------------->

that's what I came here
to these ruins to find!
<--------------------->

...But all of a sudden
this place started
floating in the air,
<--------------------->

and well, now I can't
get out.
<--------------------->

Oh, by the way, could
you help me with
something?
<--------------------->

I'm picking up signals
from 4 ancient
artifacts.
<--------------------->

I've managed to find a
few myself,
<--------------------->

but it's just too
dangerous to get close.
<--------------------->

I bet it wouldn't be a
problem for you.
<--------------------->

Could you find them and
bring them to me?
<*********************>

<p 02><a 51><n 41>
They are items
hundreds, even
thousands
<--------------------->

of years old with great
historical value.
<--------------------->

There are many people
who'd like to
<--------------------->

to get their hands on
items like that.
<--------------------->

Among them are those
who are involved in
illicit trade.
<--------------------->

My job mainly involves
catching those lowlifes
and retrieving items.
<--------------------->

If you find any items
that, please bring them
to me!
<*********************>

<p 02><a 51><n 41>
What's that you've got
there? Can I see it?
<--------------------->

Oh! This is an L
Tank, right?
<--------------------->

You know the E Tanks we
have nowadays?
<--------------------->

They've been around
hundreds of years.
<--------------------->

L Tanks came along
after the invention of
the E Tank.
<--------------------->

Performance-wise, they
are actually superior
to E Tanks,
<--------------------->

but they were never
mass-produced. 
<--------------------->

There's a famous story
of how, long ago,
<--------------------->

L Tanks helped robots
drive away gangsters
and thugs.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 51><n 41>
What's that you've got
there? Can I see it?
<--------------------->

Oh, this is a pinwheel.
<--------------------->

How'd you get your
hands on this elusive
artifact?
<--------------------->

There's speculation
among experts about
pinwheels.
<--------------------->

But I've found from my
own research that
by using the air to
<--------------------->

turn a turbine, the
wind could be harnessed
to produce energy.
<--------------------->

It was expected to be
the source of vast
energy.
<--------------------->

However, for some
reason I cannot
explain,
<--------------------->

it went largely
unnoticed and was
forgotten.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 51><n 41>
What's that you've got
there? Can I see it?
<--------------------->

Hmm... This is a
Balancer that was used
on robots
<--------------------->

a long time ago.
<--------------------->

The invention of the
Balancer
<--------------------->

has contributed so much
to our lives.
<--------------------->

It's a concept that we
now take for granted,
but before these came
<--------------------->

along, unused energy
was simply wasted into
the atmosphere.
<--------------------->

Balancers efficiently
recovered unused energy
to be used later. 
<--------------------->

Out of the need to save
energy,
<--------------------->

cleaner air was
achieved as an
unintended side-effect.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 51><n 41>
What's that you've got
there? Can I see it?
<--------------------->

Hmm... This is a light
bulb.
<--------------------->

Long ago, there used to
be solar powered
robots.
<--------------------->

They used these when
power from their solar
cells ran low.
<--------------------->

But light bulbs were
not a necessity to
daily life.
<--------------------->

Since the conflict,
energy continued to be
needlessly wasted.
<--------------------->

That eventually led to
serious global energy
shortages.
<--------------------->

Quite a sad story.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 51><n 41>
Yes! I finally have all
the ancient artifacts
from this area!
<--------------------->

Thank you very much.
I'm glad I asked you
for your help.
<--------------------->

I'd like you to have
this, for your trouble.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 51><n 41>
One more thing... Would
you take that with you?
<--------------------->

I feel like I can trust
you with it!
<*********************>

<p 02><a 51><n 41>
I once had a professor
who always said "Know
the old, know the new."
<--------------------->

Our job is not just
chasing after the
past...
<--------------------->

Remember the past to
better understand the
present. If you forget
<--------------------->

this, you become
nothing more than a
collector.
