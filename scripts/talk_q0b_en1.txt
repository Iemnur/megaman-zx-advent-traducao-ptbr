<p 02><a 66><n 32>
I'm sorry to bother you
all of a sudden,
<--------------------->

but could you do me a
favor?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 66><n 32>
I ordered a shelf to go
in this room, but it
still hasn't come yet.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 66><n 32>
I can't get in touch
with the shop,
<--------------------->

there may be some
trouble with the
network.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 66><n 32>
If you're headed
towards Legion,
<--------------------->

could you check on that
order for me?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 66><n 32>
I'll give you the money
for it.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 66><n 32>
When you get off
the train, just go
straight ahead.
<--------------------->

It'll be right there.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 66><n 32>
I believe the guy at
the shop's name was
Austin
<--------------------->

or something like that.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 66><n 32>
Oh, it's you! Look, the
new shelves have
arrived!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 66><n 32>
Thank you! Please take
this!
<*********************>

<p 02><a 66><n 32>
I've got plans to
really make this room
nice.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 66><n 32>
I may ask you for
another favor sometime.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 9A><n 51>
Hello, how may I help
you?
<*********************>

<p 02><a 9A><n 51>
Hm? That's a mission
request, isn't it? 
<--------------------->

Oh, I get it, you're
here for shelves.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 9A><n 51>
Uhm... That'll be
1000 EC!
<*********************>

<p 02><a 9A><n 51>
I tried to call you,
but it looks like there
<--------------------->

was some network
trouble.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 9A><n 51>
I'm really sorry that
you had to come out all
this way.
<--------------------->

I'll deliver the
shelves myself in a
little while.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 9A><n 51>
But it looks like you
don't have enough 
E-Crystals.
