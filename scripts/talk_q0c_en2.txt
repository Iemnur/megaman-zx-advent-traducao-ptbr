<p 02><a 56><n 3C>
This room needs a
little green. Do you
think you could go
<--------------------->

and find a plant or
something to go in
here?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 56><n 3C>
You know, I think there
were some potted plants
at Legion.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 56><n 3C>
If they were left
there, they would just
die anyway.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 56><n 3C>
And I'll give you
something for your
trouble.
<--------------------->

Not a bad deal, eh?
<*********************>

<p 02><a 56><n 3C>
Those poor plants were
just left abandoned in
the Legion building.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 56><n 3C>
I hear there are all
kinds.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 56><n 3C>
Please bring back one.
I'll leave it up to you
to decide which one.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 56><n 3C>
Thank you for bringing
the plant!
<*********************>

<p 02><a 56><n 3C>
Let's put it over
there.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 56><n 3C>
Yes, there's something
soothing about having a
plant in the room.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 56><n 3C>
This is for your
trouble.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 56><n 3C>
Be sure to come and
help me water it
sometimes, OK?
<*********************>

<p 02><a 56><n 3C>
It's not exactly what I
was expecting...
<--------------------->

But I guess it's better
than nothing.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 56><n 3C>
Anyway, thanks. Here's
your compensation.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 56><n 3C>
Plants thrive when you
talk to them. Did you
know that?
<*********************>

<p 02><a 56><n 3C>
*shriek* Did you see
that!? That flower
moved!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 56><n 3C>
Of all the plants you
could've chosen...
<--------------------->

Oh well, here's your
compensation.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 56><n 3C>
But look, these little
berry thingies. They're
so cute.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 05><n 00>
You can only pick up
one potted plant at a
time.
<*********************>

<e 01><a 05><n 00>
Pick up this one?
  Yes
  No
<*********************>

<p 02><a 05><n 00>
You picked up the
plant.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 05><n 00>
This is all you can
pick up at once.
<*********************>

<p 03><a 05><n 00>
There is a potted
plant here.
<*********************>

<p 03><a 08><n 02>
Oh, that's right! I
should give it some
water!
<*********************>

<p 03><a 05><n 00>
There's only this one
little berry...
<*********************>

<p 03><a 08><n 02>
Ouch! I should've known
better than to touch
it.
<*********************>

<p 03><a 08><n 02>
This cactus hasn't
changed a bit since I
first saw it.

This cactus hasn't

<*********************>

<p 03><a 08><n 02>
They say that it's good
to talk to plants. I
wonder if that's true.

<*********************>

<p 03><a 08><n 02>
Hello little cactus...
Can you hear me?
<*********************>

<p 03><a 08><n 02>
Why are you so quiet?
I'm just trying to make
a little conversation.
<*********************>

<p 03><a 08><n 02>
I see, you get shy in
the presence of pretty
girls, don't you?
<*********************>

<p 03><a 08><n 02>
Oh! How cute! Flowers!
<*********************>

<p 02><a 97><n 53>
Hello, I'm Janet. I
work here at this shop.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 97><n 53>
I'm afraid we're sold
out of everything but
this bucket.
<*********************>

<p 02><e 01><a 97><n 53>
Buy bucket for 100 EC?
  Yes
  No
<*********************>

<p 02><a 97><n 53>
Thank you, and have a
nice day.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 97><n 53>
Oh, you don't want to
get this? No problem, I
understand.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 97><n 53>
I'm sorry, there's a
limit of one per
customer.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 97><n 53>
I'm sorry, you don't
have enough E-Crystals.
<*********************>

<p 03><a 08><n 02>
Look! There's fruit!
