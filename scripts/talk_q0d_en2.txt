(I wonder what
happened. The Hunters
that took off)
<--------------------->

(toward the Control
Center aren't back
yet.)
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 66><n 32>
Oh! You're just in
time.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 66><n 32>
The Hunters that went
to pick up the
chandelier
<--------------------->

aren't back yet. I'm
worried that something
might have happened.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 66><n 32>
Would you mind looking
for them?
<--------------------->

I'll make sure you're
well compensated.

<p 02><a 66><n 32>
They should be in one
of the rooms of the
Control Center.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 66><n 32>
Please be careful.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 42><n 4E>
Are you here to help
us?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 42><n 4E>
Oh, Romeo sent you, eh?
Thanks. One of our guys
got hit. He's resting.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 42><n 4E>
It looks like you took
out all of the
Mavericks in the area.
<--------------------->

So, we should be OK
getting back.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 42><n 4E>
Tell Romeo that we're
on our way with the
chandelier.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 66><n 32>
Hey, it's you. Thank
you for helping
those Hunters out.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 66><n 32>
Here's what I promised
you.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 66><n 32>
When I was putting up
the chandelier in the
room,
<--------------------->

that girl in there
yelled at me. *sigh*
<*********************>

<p 02><a 42><n 4F>
I got a little banged
up, but I'm gonna be
alright.
<--------------------->

I needed the rest
anyway. 
<*********************>

<p 02><a 42><n 4F>
Thanks to you, we got
the job done!
