Since I was a little
kid, I've wanted a
model train set.
<--------------------->

I haven't stopped
looking for one, even
to this day.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 4C><n 31>
I've looked just about
everywhere, but they're
really hard to find.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 4C><n 31>
Say? Could you look for
one for me?

I wonder if somebody in
Hunter's Camp might
have one.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 4C><n 31>
I remember Ray, the
Comic Hunter saying he
doesn't have one.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 4C><n 31>
Yep, this is exactly
what I've been
looking for.
<--------------------->

Just looking at it
takes me back to
my childhood!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 4C><n 31>
Thank you! This is for
your trouble!
<*********************>

<p 02><a 4C><n 31>
I think I'll have it
set up on the shelf
in that big room.

You say you want a
model train? I have one
of those, but...
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 45><n 3A>
I know! If you get me
some pudding, I'll make
a trade with you.
