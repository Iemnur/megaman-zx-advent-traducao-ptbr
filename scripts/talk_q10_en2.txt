<p 02><a 43><n 2B>
It seems that the
remains of a rare
ancient Mechaniloid
<--------------------->

were found in the Oil
Fields.
<--------------------->

With all of the
reporters and press
everywhere,
<--------------------->

it's practically
impossible to get to
that area.
<--------------------->

Besides, I can't go out
there.
<--------------------->

Everybody knows the
Oil Fields are just too
dangerous.
<--------------------->

If I could only
pinpoint the location
<--------------------->

of the Mechaniloid
remains, I could have
some guys go in.
<--------------------->

Could I get you to go
and put this micro
transmitter at the site
<--------------------->

of the Mechaniloid
remains?
<*********************>

<p 02><a 43><n 2B>
They're probably buried
beneath the sand, so
keep a close eye out.
<--------------------->

I know you can do it.
I'm counting on you.
<--------------------->

This is going to be a
big scoop.
<--------------------->

I'd better get this
computer ready to
perform an analysis.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 43><n 2B>
Thank you! My guys just
got back with the
Mechaniloid remains.
<--------------------->

The analysis results
indicate that this
Mechaniloid
<--------------------->

is very, very old.
<--------------------->

Most likely, those Oil
Fields are all that's
left
<--------------------->

of a dried up ancient
sea.
<--------------------->

Oh, by the way! The
Hunters brought back
this...
<--------------------->

I don't have any use
for it, so I'll give it
to you.
