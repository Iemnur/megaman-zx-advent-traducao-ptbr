You know, this room
could use some life.
<--------------------->

Been thinking about
turning it into a café.
<--------------------->

Jim, the Hunter, let me
borrow his blueprints
for a café,
<--------------------->

but I lost them while
walking back from Jim's
café.
<--------------------->

It was really windy.
Even if I did manage to
find them,
<--------------------->

it'd probably be
in some place too hard
for me to reach.
<--------------------->

I feel terrible for
asking a favor of
someone I just met,
<--------------------->

but would you mind
looking for them?
<*********************>

<p 02><a 52><n 38>
Jim was nice enough to
lend me his blueprints,
<--------------------->

but I went off and lost
them.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 52><n 38>
Hopefully, they're just
caught on some fence
out there.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 52><n 38>
Thank you. Now I can
finally build that
café!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 52><n 38>
Oh, and I can start by
selling E Tanks or
something.
<*********************>

<p 02><e 63><a 52><n 38>
An E Tank for 500 EC?
  Yes
  No

<p 02><a 08><n 01>
It looks like there's
only an old-school
<--------------------->

Reploid cooling system
in here.

Oh? There's cake in
here! Well, finders
keepers.
<--------------------->

I wonder whose it is?
<*********************>

<p 02><a 08><n 02>
Too bad, I was hoping
to find some chilled
fruit. Oh well...

Nick's self-intro
<*********************>

<p 02><a 52><n 38>
You can only carry one
E Tank at a time.
<--------------------->

So when it's empty,
just come back again.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 52><n 38>
Sorry, but it looks
like you don't have
enough E-Crystals.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 52><n 38>
If you're ever in the
area again, be sure to
stop by, OK?
