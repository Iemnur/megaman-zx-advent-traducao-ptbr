Oh no... What should I
do?
<--------------------->

When I opened my little
bird's cage to feed
her, she flew away. 
<--------------------->

I would go look for her
myself, but I have to
stay here.
<--------------------->

Could you look for my
bird for me? Please?
<--------------------->

She's a cute little
white bird. Her name is
Nightingale.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 5E><n 42>
Well? Do you have any
idea where she could
have gone?
<--------------------->

Someone did say that
they heard a bird
singing
<--------------------->

beyond that green door.

<p 02><a 5E><n 42>
Thank you... I guess I
should buy a better
cage.
