Hey, my daddy says that
in the olden days there
used to be supercool
<--------------------->

superheroes. Did you
know that!?
<--------------------->

But he said that was
long, long ago,
<--------------------->

so there aren't many
pictures of them left.
<--------------------->

Aah... I sure would
like to see a legendary
superhero.
<--------------------->

Do you know any
superheroes?
<--------------------->

I know! Could you find
somebody
<--------------------->

who has some legendary
superhero stuff!?
<--------------------->

Pleeease! I'll give you
my favorite pin from my
pin collection.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 62><n 30>
I'm so excited! I
wonder what legendary
superheroes were like.
<--------------------->

If I get my hands on
some legendary
superhero stuff,
<--------------------->

I'm gonna keep it
forever.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 62><n 30>
Huh? Secret Disk...?
This flying disc toy
thing?
<--------------------->

The picture on the
package was scary,
<--------------------->

it didn't look like a
legendary hero to me.
<--------------------->

It sure wasn't the kind
of superhero I had
imagined.
<--------------------->

I'm sorry I put you to
the trouble. Here, I'll
give you this disk. 
<--------------------->

But I want my pin back
though!
<*********************>

<p 02><a 4B><n 45>
Legendary superhero
stuff?
<--------------------->

Oh, I was kind of
short on cash a while
back,
<--------------------->

so I sold all that
stuff.
<--------------------->

That Hunter Tina said
she wanted to see some
pics of cool guys.
<--------------------->

I didn't want to give
it to her, but she
wanted it sooo bad.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 50><n 39>
Huh? You're looking for
some legendary
superhero stuff?
<--------------------->

Let me think... Did I
have something like
that...?
<--------------------->

Aah, you must be
thinking about that
secret disk.
<--------------------->

I gave that away to one
of the kids in Hunter's
Camp!
<--------------------->

I heard it had some
pictures of nice guy's
on it,
<--------------------->

so I bought it for 300
EC!
<*********************>

<p 02><a 50><n 39>
That Ray guy really got
me on that one!
