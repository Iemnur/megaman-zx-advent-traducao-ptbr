<p 02><a 96><n 50>
Oh yeah! Now I
remember!
<--------------------->

I heard that there's a
fire breaking out in
the Legion building...
<--------------------->

If that's true, I'm
worried.
<--------------------->

I can't go and check it
out with all of those
Mechaniloids around.
<--------------------->

Could you go take a
look and put out the
fire if there is one?
<*********************>

<p 02><a 96><n 50>
If you have water, you
should be able to douse
the flames.
<--------------------->

Please hurry! I'm
worried that people
could be hurt.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 96><n 50>
I'm relieved to hear
that the fire is out.
Thank you very much.
<--------------------->

This used to be my
older brother's. Please
take it.
