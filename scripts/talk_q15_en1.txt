*Moan* What a
predicament... What am
I going to do?
<--------------------->

Never mind. I was just
talking to myself. It's
none of your concern.
<--------------------->

But if you really want
to hear about it,
I'll tell you.
<--------------------->

Well...
<--------------------->

You know how there's a
miniature flying
surveillance camera
<--------------------->

in Hunter's Camp
that looks like a bird?
<--------------------->

Well, the other day,
while performing a
sweep
<--------------------->

over the Control Center
area,
<--------------------->

the Mini-Cam picked up
on something abnormal
<--------------------->

and took off toward an
area of smoke.
<--------------------->

Of course I would go
out there and retrieve
it by myself,
<--------------------->

but I have to hurry
back home to take care
of something.
<--------------------->

Uh, I don't have to go
right this moment. But
since you're here,
<--------------------->

I thought I'd let you
have the honor, ya
know.
<--------------------->

The Mini-Cam even acts
just like a little
bird,
<--------------------->

so I'll give you this
cage!
<*********************>

<p 02><a 54><n 3D>
I think it took off
somewhere up high in
the Control Center.
<--------------------->

I tell ya, the stuff
that thing is capable
of doing...
<--------------------->

It drives me crazy
sometimes.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 54><n 3D>
What? You found the
Mini-Cam?
<--------------------->

Man, you are an ace
Hunter. I could
tell when we first met.
<--------------------->

Let me return the
favor.
<--------------------->

Keep the cage. You can
use it to decorate your
room or something.
