<--------------------->

Oh hi, it's you! I
didn't notice you
there.
<--------------------->

Hmm... I'm sooo
stressing out right
now.
<--------------------->

Never mind, I'm just
having a personal
problem.
<--------------------->

There's someone I like,
<--------------------->

but I don't know how I
can get her to notice
me.
<--------------------->

They say there's a
Magical Fruit... And
that if you eat it,
<--------------------->

you'll fall in love
with the person who
gave it to you.
<--------------------->

If I could only get
that fruit and make
juice out of it,
<--------------------->

then I could give it to
the girl I like to
drink.
<--------------------->

Hey, could you do me a
favor?
<--------------------->

They say you can find
the Magical Fruit at
the Tower of Verdure.
<--------------------->

Could you go and find
it for me?
<*********************>

<p 02><a 53><n 3F>
I wonder if that fruit
is really even at the
Tower of Verdure.
<--------------------->

I've heard that the
fruit is very delicate.
<--------------------->

And if you're not
careful while picking
it, you can ruin it.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 53><n 3F>
You got it for me!? But
it just looks like an
ordinary green apple.
<--------------------->

Oh well. Anyway, thank
you very much!
