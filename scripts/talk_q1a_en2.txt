Where're Lazarus and
Red?
<--------------------->

You don't hear about
many people falling
from an airship
<--------------------->

and living to tell
about it...
<--------------------->

But I'm gonna keep hope
alive. I got faith.
<--------------------->

I believe they're still
alive out there
somewhere.
<--------------------->

I know you must be
pretty shook up too,
Ashe.
<--------------------->

If you find those two
out there on the road,
I know you'll
<--------------------->

do what you can for
'em. Please... I'm
counting on you.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 72><n 1C>
If we survived, so can
they!
<--------------------->

It's just a hunch, but
they should be
somewhere between
<--------------------->

here and the Oil
Fields.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 72><n 1C>
Ashe! Lazarus came back
alive!
<--------------------->

Ha-haa! That
knucklehead... He had
me worried to death!
<--------------------->

He was kinda up tight
that you saved him, but
he's always like that.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 72><n 1C>
Ashe! Red came back
alive!
<--------------------->

Ha-haa! That
knucklehead... He had
me worried to death!
<--------------------->

And he thought
survival skills were
overrated...
<--------------------->

At least he's back in
one piece.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 72><n 1C>
We've finally got the
gang back together.
Thanks a million, Ashe!
<--------------------->

As for me... I think
I'll go back to being a
Hunter.
<--------------------->

Now that those guys are
back in action, I can't
just sit around
<--------------------->

like some lily-livered
coward, ya know.
<--------------------->

Next time'll be our
turn to help you.
<--------------------->

If you need anything,
just give us a holler!
<*********************>

<p 02><a 72><n 1C>
Ahh, if it isn't
Ashe...
<*********************>

<p 02><a 72><n 1C>
To be entrusted with a
mission from Legion,
<--------------------->

you're obviously quite
a Hunter!
<*********************>

<p 02><a 72><n 1C>
Mavericks are on the
rise, but with you
here,
<--------------------->

there's nothing to
worry about!
<*********************>

<p 02><a 72><n 1C>
If you ever have a
problem, Ashe,
<--------------------->

I'll be more than happy
to lend a hand!
<*********************>

<p 02><a 74><n 1D>
...What? You came to
help ME!? Nonsense! I'm
fine!
<--------------------->

When I came to, I'd
been washed up to this
area.
<--------------------->

It was kinda hard
to move...
<--------------------->

So, I just decided to
take a rest here.
That's all!
<--------------------->

...Whaddaya mean, can I
get back by myself?
Dummy! Don't be silly!
<--------------------->

I told you, I ran out
of energy and I
couldn't move.
<--------------------->

That's why I couldn't
go back.
<--------------------->

...Hey, C'mon, gimme a
break. I'm in trouble
here. Help me...
<*********************>

<p 02><a 74><n 1D>
What?
<*********************>

<p 02><a 74><n 1D>
I dunno what would've
happened to me by now
<--------------------->

if Ashe hadn't come
along and helped me.

<p 02><a 73><n 1E>
Ashe, finally you're
here. I was waiting for
you.
<--------------------->

I held onto that
Airship
<--------------------->

like there was no
tomorrow as it was
going down,
<--------------------->

but the impact of the
crash threw me
somewhere near here.
<--------------------->

When I realized that I
had been separated from
the group,
<--------------------->

I knew I'd have to set
up camp.
<--------------------->

Fortunately this room
turned out to be
<--------------------->

some kind of energy
storehouse.
<--------------------->

"I could survive in
here for a while," I
thought to myself...
<--------------------->

and decided to go
outside for some air.
<--------------------->

It was then that I
realized that the door
was stuck,
<--------------------->

and I was trapped! I
was like, "what the
heck's going on?!".
<--------------------->

So I waited, believing
that somebody would
come to my rescue...
<--------------------->

Uh? Yo Ashe, are you
yawning!?
<--------------------->

Am I boring you with my
tale of woe over here!?
<*********************>

<p 02><a 73><n 1E>
Hey, my hero, Ashe!
<*********************>

<p 02><a 73><n 1E>
When I was trapped in
that energy storehouse,
<--------------------->

I had no idea what
would happen to me.
