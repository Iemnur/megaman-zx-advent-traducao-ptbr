<p 02><a 46><n 44>
They call me James.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 46><n 44>
Yeah... Whaddaya say
you bring me some junk
to recycle.
<--------------------->

And I'll turn it into
sump'm useful fer ya.
<--------------------->

Of course, it'll cost
ya though.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 46><n 44>
What is it? What're ya
starin' at me like that
fer?
<--------------------->

I bet you're one of
them fools zat thinks
<--------------------->

junk is jus' garbage to
be thrown away.
<--------------------->

Take a lookit that
scrap iron over there.
<--------------------->

There ain't much to it
now,
<--------------------->

But I betcha didn't
know that if you
collect enough of it,
<--------------------->

you can use it to make
a spare body part.
<--------------------->

That's called being
recycle conscious. 
<--------------------->

But you wouldn't know
anything about that
now, would ya?
<*********************>

<p 02><a 46><n 44>
Ya know engine
ignitions have titanium
alloy in 'em.
<--------------------->

I can recycle this into
sump'm nice fer ya,
<--------------------->

but it'll cost ya
100 EC.
<*********************>

<p 02><e 63><a 46><n 44>
Wanna recycle this?
  Yes
  No
<*********************>

<p 02><a 46><n 44>
Alrighty I'll have
that fer ya in a jiffy.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 46><n 44>
There! A booster.
<--------------------->

How ya use it is up to
you. If ya need sump'm
else,
<--------------------->

just bring me
some more junk to
recycle.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 46><n 44>
Ya ain't got enough
money, ya dipstick.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 46><n 44>
Have you been listenin'
to a dang word I said?
<--------------------->

That's just what I'm
talkin' about. These
young whippersnappers
<--------------------->

t'day jus' ain't got it
in 'em to recycle. Git
outta my sight!
<*********************>

<p 02><a 46><n 44>
Well, looks like you've
finally come 'round to
recycling.
<--------------------->

Ya know, there's some
folks who'll never
change...
<--------------------->

They jus' can't,
I guess.
<--------------------->

Just a little junk can
turn into a mountain in
no time...
<--------------------->

Like this one.
<--------------------->

It's one thing to wake
up and smell the coffee
late, and another thing
<--------------------->

to not wake up at all,
let alone smell the
coffee... Ya get me?
<--------------------->

These Mechaniloids
around here,
<--------------------->

they come from all the
junk that people throw
away.
<--------------------->

Do ya know what that
means? People,
<--------------------->

the ones who threw away
that junk have, by
their own hand,
<--------------------->

put themselves on the
path to destruction.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 46><n 44>
By the way, what'd ya
do with the booster I
made fer ya?
<--------------------->

So ya found a good use
fer it, huh. Good fer
you.
<--------------------->

Now if ya ever need
sump'm else, jus' like
I said before, 
<--------------------->

bring me some good
junk.
<--------------------->

And I'll turn it into
sump'm useful fer ya.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 46><n 44>
What is it? What're ya
starin' at me like that
fer?
<--------------------->

Haa, looks like you ya
forgot where the stuff
to make a booster is.
<--------------------->

I'm telling ya, finding
the junk you want isn't
as easy as you think.
<--------------------->

Search every nook and
cranny of Scrapyard 2
and 3.
<--------------------->

I got faith in
ya, son.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 46><n 44>
An Engine ignition...
These have titanium
alloy in 'em.
<--------------------->

I can make you a
booster from this, but
it'll cost ya 100 EC.
<*********************>

<p 02><e 63><a 46><n 44>
Wanna recycle this?
  Yes
  No
<*********************>

<p 03><a 46><n 44>
There! A booster.
<--------------------->

How ya use it is up to
you. If ya need sump'm
else,
<--------------------->

just bring me
some more junk to
recycle.
