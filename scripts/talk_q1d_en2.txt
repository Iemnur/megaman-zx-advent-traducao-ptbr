There's something that
needs doing,
<--------------------->

and you look like just
the person to do it.
<--------------------->

A hoard of Chabanos has
escaped from this area.
<--------------------->

If you find any green
ones on the road,
please eliminate them.
<--------------------->

Can you do that?
<--------------------->

There couldn't have
been more than 50,
so get them all.
<--------------------->

There's a reward if you
manage to get all of
them. 
<*********************>

<p 02><a 44><n 35>
There's a pretty good
chance
<--------------------->

that the Chabanos have
gotten out into the
wild.
<--------------------->

I'd like you to
eradicate those buggers
for me.
<--------------------->

You can think of it as
a side job.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 44><n 35>
Oh-hoh! Looks like you
took care of all of
those Chabanos!
<--------------------->

Excellent work! I want
you to take this,
<--------------------->

and I won't take no for
an answer.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 44><n 35>
I may not look it, but
I'm a Hunter.
<--------------------->

The others call me the
Chemical Hunter.
<--------------------->

You see I do scientific
research
<--------------------->

that goes to benefit
the Hunter's
livelihood.
<--------------------->

But even though I'm a
Hunter in title,
<--------------------->

I leave the rigorous
physical part to the
others.
<--------------------->

Thank you so much for
your help.
